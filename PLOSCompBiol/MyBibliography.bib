abstract = {DNA microarrays can be used to identify gene expression changes characteristic of human disease. This is challenging, however, when relevant differences are subtle at the level of individual genes. We introduce an analytical strategy, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, designed to detect modest but coordinate changes in the expression of groups of functionally related genes. Using this approach, we identify a set of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation whose expression is coordinately decreased in human diabetic muscle. Expression of these genes is high at sites of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, activated by PGC-1alpha and correlated with total-body aerobic capacity. Our results associate this gene set with clinically important variation in human metabolism and illustrate the value of pathway relationships in the analysis of genomic profiling experiments.},

GEO provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission, storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments. GEO is not intended to replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.},

The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80{\%} of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

abstract = {Although all human tissues carry out common processes, tissues are distinguished by gene expres-sion patterns, implying that distinct regulatory programs control tissue-specificity. In this study, we investigate gene expression and regulation across 38 tissues profiled in the Genotype-Tissue Ex-pression project. We find that network edges (transcription factor to target gene connections) have higher tissue-specificity than network nodes (genes) and that regulating nodes (transcription fac-tors) are less likely to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner as compared to their targets (genes). Gene set enrichment analysis of network targeting also indicates that regulation of tissue-specific function is largely independent of transcription factor expression. In addition, tissue-specific genes are not highly targeted in their corresponding tissue-network. However, they assume bottleneck po-sitions due to changes in transcription factor targeting and the influence of non-canonical regulatory interactions. These results suggest that tissue-specificity is driven by the creation of new regulatory paths, providing transcriptional control of tissue-specific processes.},

Despite the suggestion that regulatory element disruption represents a common theme, identifying causal risk variants within implicated genomic regions remains a major challenge. Here we present a new sequence-based computational method to predict the effect of regulatory variation, using a classifier (gkm-SVM) that encodes cell type-specific regulatory sequence vocabularies. The induced change in the gkm-SVM score, deltaSVM, quantifies the effect of variants. We show that deltaSVM accurately predicts the impact of SNPs on DNase I sensitivity in their native genomic contexts and accurately predicts the results of dense mutagenesis of several enhancers in reporter assays. Previously validated GWAS SNPs yield large deltaSVM scores, and we predict new risk-conferring SNPs for several autoimmune diseases. Thus, deltaSVM provides a powerful computational approach to systematically identify functional regulatory variants.},

abstract = {Previous work showed that the Th2 cytokine interleukin (IL)-13 induces goblet cell metaplasia via an indirect mechanism involving the expression and subsequent activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Because Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) expression has been reported in cells that express mucins, we examined the effect of IL-13 on CCSP gene and protein expression in pathogen-free rat airways and in pulmonary mucoepidermoid NCI-H292 cells. Intratracheal instillation of IL-13 induced CCSP mRNA in epithelial cells without cilia within 8-16 h, maximal between 24 and 48 h; CCSP immunostaining increased in a time-dependent fashion, maximal at 48 h. The CCSP immunostaining was localized in nongranulated secretory cells and goblet cells and in the lumen. Pretreatment with the selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBX1522, cyclophosphamide (an inhibitor of bone marrow leukocyte mobilization), or a blocking antibody to IL-8 prevented CCSP staining. Treatment of NCI-H292 cells with the EGFR ligand transforming growth factor-alpha, but not with IL-13 alone, induced CCSP gene and protein expression. Selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, BIBX1522 and AG1478, prevented CCSP expression in NCI-H292 cells, but the platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1295 had no effect. These findings indicate that IL-13 induces CCSP expression via an EGFR- and leukocyte-dependent pathway.},

Here, we show that polymorphism at a remote intergenic region on chromosome 11q13.3, recently identified as a susceptibility locus for renal cell carcinoma, modulates the binding and function of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) at a previously unrecognized transcriptional enhancer of CCND1 (encoding cyclin D1) that is specific for renal cancers characterized by inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL). The protective haplotype impairs binding of HIF-2, resulting in an allelic imbalance in cyclin D1 expression, thus affecting a link between hypoxia pathways and cell cycle control.},

@article{Bigham2010,
abstract = {High-altitude hypoxia (reduced inspired oxygen tension due to decreased barometric pressure) exerts severe physiological stress on the human body. Two high-altitude regions where humans have lived for millennia are the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau. Populations living in these regions exhibit unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations to life at high altitude. Although these responses have been well characterized physiologically, their underlying genetic basis remains unknown. We performed a genome scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to hypoxia. We looked across each chromosome to identify genomic regions with previously unknown function with respect to altitude phenotypes. In addition, groups of genes functioning in oxygen metabolism and sensing were examined to test the hypothesis that particular pathways have been involved in genetic adaptation to altitude. Applying four population genetic statistics commonly used for detecting signatures of natural selection, we identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in these two populations (Andeans and Tibetans) separately. The Tibetan and Andean patterns of genetic adaptation are largely distinct from one another, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. Interestingly, one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. However, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations. Our results indicate that several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different chromosomal regions are implicated in the putative response to selection. These data suggest a genetic role in high-altitude adaption and provide a basis for future genotype/phenotype association studies necessary to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude.},

abstract = {Hypoxia activates the expression of proangiogenic and survival promoting factors as well as proinflammatory cytokines that support tissue inflammation. Hypoxia and inflammation are associated with tumor progression. The identification of the factors participating in the hypoxia associated inflammation is essential to develop strategies to control tumor hypoxia. The transcription factor ZNF395 was found to be overexpressed in various tumors including glioblastomas particularly in the network of a hypoxic response pointing to a functional role of ZNF395. On the other hand, ZNF395 was suggested to have tumor suppressor activities which may rely on its repression of proinflammatory factors. To address these conflictive observations, we investigated the role of ZNF395 in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the astrocytoma cell line U87-MG under hypoxia. We show that ZNF395 is a target gene of the hypoxia inducible factor HIF-1 {\$}\alpha{\$} . By gene expression analysis, RT-PCR and ELISA, we demonstrated that the siRNA-mediated suppression of ZNF395 impairs the hypoxic induction of IL-1 {\$}\beta{\$} , IL-6, IL-8, and LIF in U87-MG cells. At ambient oxygen concentrations, ZNF395 had no enhancing effect, indicating that this transcriptional activation by ZNF395 is restricted to hypoxic conditions. Our results suggest that ZNF395 contributes to hypoxia associated inflammation by superactivating proinflammatory cytokines.},

@article{Gomez-Maldonado2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved. The presence of hypoxic regions in solid tumors is an adverse prognostic factor for patient outcome. Here, we show that hypoxia induces the expression of Ephrin-A3 through a novel hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated mechanism. In response to hypoxia, the coding EFNA3 mRNA levels remained relatively stable, but HIFs drove the expression of previously unknown long noncoding (lnc) RNAs from EFNA3 locus and these lncRNA caused Ephrin-A3 protein accumulation. Ephrins are cell surface proteins that regulate diverse biological processes by modulating cellular adhesion and repulsion. Mounting evidence implicates deregulated ephrin function in multiple aspects of tumor biology. We demonstrate that sustained expression of both Ephrin-A3 and novel EFNA3 lncRNAs increased the metastatic potential of human breast cancer cells, possibly by increasing the ability of tumor cells to extravasate from the blood vessels into surrounding tissue. In agreement, we found a strong correlation between high EFNA3 expression and shorter metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients. Taken together, our results suggest that hypoxia could contribute to metastatic spread of breast cancer via HIF-mediated induction of EFNA3 lncRNAs and subsequent Ephrin-A3 protein accumulation.},

abstract = {We describe a novel cloning method, referred to as insert-tagged (InTag) positive selection, for the rapid one-step reformatting of phage-displayed antibody fragments to full-length immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs). InTag positive selection enables recombinant clones of interest to be directly selected without cloning background, bypassing the laborious process of plating out cultures and colony screening and enabling the cloning procedure to be automated and performed in a high-throughput format. This removes a significant bottleneck in the functional screening of phage-derived antibody candidates and enables a large number of clones to be directly reformatted into IgG without the intermediate step of Escherichia coli expression and testing of soluble antibody fragments. The use of InTag positive selection with the Dyax Fab-on-phage antibody library is demonstrated, and optimized methods for the small-scale transient expression of IgGs at high levels are described. InTag positive selection cloning has the potential for wide application in high-throughput DNA cloning involving multiple inserts, markedly improving the speed and quality of selections from protein libraries.},

abstract = {Adaptation to hypoxia is a crucial process both physiologically (i.e. in chondrocytes) and pathologically (i.e. in tumor cells). Previous studies have shown that DEC1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is induced by hypoxia in glioma cells (Ivanova, A. V., Ivanov, S. V., Danilkovitch-Miagkova, A., and Lerman, M. I. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 15306-15315). In the present study, we found that hypoxia or CoCl(2) enhanced the mRNA expression of DEC2, as well as DEC1, within 24 h in chondrogenic ATDC5, 293T, and HeLa cells. In luciferase assays, the regions between -524 and -401 in the DEC1 promoter, and between -863 and -258 in the DEC2 promoter, were responsible for the hypoxia- or hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha)-induced transcription. In these regions, we identified functional hypoxia response elements (HREs) that bound to HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta. In addition to an HIF-1 binding site consensus sequence, the DEC1 HRE had cAMP response element-like and CACAG sequences, which were also involved in the transcription activation in response to HIF-1alpha. Although the DEC2 HRE did not have a cAMP response element-like or CACAG sequence, it showed a higher affinity for HIF-1 than did the DEC1 HRE. Because DEC1 and DEC2 are directly inducible by HIF-1, these transcription factors may be crucial for the adaptation to hypoxia.},

abstract = {Mutations in VHL underlie von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a hereditary cancer syndrome with several subtypes depending on the risk of developing certain combination of classic features, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), hemangioblastoma and pheochromocytoma. Although numerous potential substrates and functions of pVHL have been described over the past decade, the best-defined role of pVHL has remained as the negative regulator of the heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor via the oxygen-dependent ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HIF-$\alpha$ subunit. Despite the seminal discoveries that led to the molecular elucidation of the mammalian oxygen-sensing VHL-HIF axis, which have provided several rational therapies, the mechanisms underlying the complex genotype-phenotype correlation in VHL disease are unclear. This review will discuss and highlight the studies that have provided interesting insights as well as uncertainties to the underlying mechanisms governing VHL disease.Oncogene advance online publication, 18 September 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.338.},

abstract = {Coordinate control of gene activity is critical for fitness and longevity of an organism. The SIN3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex functions as a transcriptional repressor of many genes. SIN3-regulated genes include those that encode proteins affecting multiple aspects of mitochondrial function, such as energy production and stress responsiveness, important for health maintenance. Here we used Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to examine the role of SIN3 in the regulation of fitness and longevity. Adult flies with RNA interference (RNAi) induced knockdown expression of Sin3A have reduced climbing ability; an activity that likely requires fully functional mitochondria. Additionally, compared to wild type, adult Sin3A knockdown flies were more sensitive to oxidative stress. Interestingly, media supplementation with the antioxidant glutathione largely restored fly tolerance to oxidative stress. Although Sin3A knockdown flies exhibited decreased longevity compared to wild type, no significant changes in expression of many well-categorized aging genes were observed. We found, however, that Sin3A knockdown corresponded to a significant reduction in expression of genes encoding proteins involved in the de novo synthesis of glutathione. Taken together, the data support a model whereby SIN3 regulates a gene expression program required for proper mitochondrial function and effective stress response during adulthood.},

abstract = {Cis-regulatory elements such as transcription factor (TF) binding sites can be identified genome-wide, but it remains far more challenging to pinpoint genetic variants affecting TF binding. Here, we introduce a pooling-based approach to mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for molecular-level traits. Applying this to five TFs and a histone modification, we mapped thousands of cis-acting QTLs, with over 25-fold lower cost compared to standard QTL mapping. We found that single genetic variants frequently affect binding of multiple TFs, and CTCF can recruit all five TFs to its binding sites. These QTLs often affect local chromatin and transcription but can also influence long-range chromosomal contacts, demonstrating a role for natural genetic variation in chromosomal architecture. Thousands of these QTLs have been implicated in genome-wide association studies, providing candidate molecular mechanisms for many disease risk loci and suggesting that TF binding variation may underlie a large fraction of human phenotypic variation.},

We undertook integrated genomic analyses of both non-coding and coding transcripts using massively parallel sequencing and interfaced this data with pan-genomic analyses of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and RNApol2 binding in hypoxic cells. These analyses revealed that all classes of RNA are profoundly regulated by hypoxia and implicated HIF as a major direct regulator of both the non-coding and coding transcriptome, acting predominantly through release of pre-bound promoter-paused RNApol2. These findings indicate that the transcriptional response to hypoxia is substantially more extensive than previously considered.},

abstract = {RNA levels in a cell are determined by the relative rates of RNA synthesis and decay. State-of-the-art transcriptional analyses only employ total cellular RNA. Therefore, changes in RNA levels cannot be attributed to RNA synthesis or decay, and temporal resolution is poor. Recently, it was reported that newly transcribed RNA can be biosynthetically labeled for 1-2 h using thiolated nucleosides, purified from total cellular RNA and subjected to microarray analysis. However, in order to study signaling events at molecular level, analysis of changes occurring within minutes is required. We developed an improved approach to separate total cellular RNA into newly transcribed and preexisting RNA following 10-15 min of metabolic labeling. Employing new computational tools for array normalization and half-life determination we simultaneously study short-term RNA synthesis and decay as well as their impact on cellular transcript levels. As an example we studied the response of fibroblasts to type I and II interferons (IFN). Analysis of RNA transcribed within 15-30 min at different times during the first three hours of interferon-receptor activation resulted in a {\textgreater}10-fold increase in microarray sensitivity and provided a comprehensive profile of the kinetics of IFN-mediated changes in gene expression. We identify a previously undisclosed highly connected network of short-lived transcripts selectively down-regulated by IFNgamma in between 30 and 60 min after IFN treatment showing strong associations with cell cycle and apoptosis, indicating novel mechanisms by which IFNgamma affects these pathways.},

We developed a simple and powerful approach for performing native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in human cells that globally maps strand-specific Pol II density at nucleotide resolution. NET-seq exposes a mode of antisense transcription that originates downstream and converges on transcription from the canonical promoter. Convergent transcription is associated with a distinctive chromatin configuration and is characteristic of lower-expressed genes. Integration of NET-seq with genomic footprinting data reveals stereotypic Pol II pausing coincident with transcription factor occupancy. Finally, exons retained in mature transcripts display Pol II pausing signatures that differ markedly from skipped exons, indicating an intrinsic capacity for Pol II to recognize exons with different processing fates. Together, human NET-seq exposes the topography and regulatory complexity of human gene expression.},

Here we report that hypoxia, chemical inhibition of the oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs), and silencing of Phd2 induce immature filopodium-like dendritic protrusions, promote spine regression, reduce synaptic density, and decrease the frequency of spontaneous action potentials independently of HIF signaling. We identified the actin cross-linker filamin A (FLNA) as a target of PHD2 mediating these effects. In normoxia, PHD2 hydroxylates the proline residues P2309 and P2316 in FLNA, leading to von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In hypoxia, PHD2 inactivation rapidly upregulates FLNA protein levels because of blockage of its proteasomal degradation. FLNA upregulation induces more immature spines, whereas Flna silencing rescues the immature spine phenotype induced by PHD2 inhibition.},

Here, we define a conserved HIF-VHL-prolyl hydroxylase pathway in C. elegans, and use a genetic approach to identify EGL-9 as a dioxygenase that regulates HIF by prolyl hydroxylation. In mammalian cells, we show that the HIF-prolyl hydroxylases are represented by a series of isoforms bearing a conserved 2-histidine-1-carboxylate iron coordination motif at the catalytic site. Direct modulation of recombinant enzyme activity by graded hypoxia, iron chelation, and cobaltous ions mirrors the characteristics of HIF induction in vivo, fulfilling requirements for these enzymes being oxygen sensors that regulate HIF.},

abstract = {Chuvash polycythemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that is endemic to the mid-Volga River region. We previously mapped the locus associated with Chuvash polycythemia to chromosome 3p25. The gene associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, VHL, maps to this region, and homozygosity with respect to a C--{\textgreater}T missense mutation in VHL, causing an arginine-to-tryptophan change at amino-acid residue 200 (Arg200Trp), was identified in all individuals affected with Chuvash polycythemia. The protein VHL modulates the ubiquitination and subsequent destruction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1, subunit alpha (HIF1alpha). Our data indicate that the Arg200Trp substitution impairs the interaction of VHL with HIF1alpha, reducing the rate of degradation of HIF1alpha and resulting in increased expression of downstream target genes including EPO (encoding erythropoietin), SLC2A1 (also known as GLUT1, encoding solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 1), TF (encoding transferrin), TFRC (encoding transferrin receptor (p90, CD71)) and VEGF (encoding vascular endothelial growth factor).},

@article{Hu2011a,
abstract = {Rampant activity of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 in cancer is frequently associated with the malignant progression into a harder-to-treat, increasingly aggressive phenotype. Clearly, anti-HIF strategies in cancer cells are of considerable clinical interest. One way to fine-tune, or inhibit, HIF's transcriptional outflow independently of hydroxylase activities could be through competing transcription factors. A CACGTG-binding activity in human hepatoma cells was previously found to restrict HIF's access to hypoxia response cis-elements (HRE) in a Daphnia globin gene promoter construct (phb2). The CACGTG factor, and its impact on hypoxia-responsive human genes, was analyzed in this study by genome-wide computational scans as well as gene-specific quantitative PCR, reporter and DNA-binding assays in hepatoma (Hep3B), cervical carcinoma (HeLa), and breast carcinoma (MCF7) cells. Among six basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors known to target CACGTG palindromes, we identified upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-1/2 as predominant phb2 CACGTG constituents in Hep3B, HeLa, and MCF7 cells. Human genes with adjacent or overlapping HRE and CACGTG motifs included with lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and Bcl-2/E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) hypoxia-induced HIF-1 targets. Parallel recruitment of HIF-1$\alpha$ and USF1/2a to the respective promoter chromatin was verified for all cell lines investigated. Mutual complementing (LDHA) or moderating (BNIP3) cross-talk was seen upon overexpression or silencing of HIF-1$\alpha$ and USF1/2a. Distinct (LDHA) or overlapping (BNIP3) promoter-binding sites for HIF-1 and USFs were subsequently characterized. We propose that, depending on abundance or activity of its protein constituents, O(2)-independent USF signaling can function to fine-tune or interfere with HIF-mediated transcription in cancer cells.},

abstract = {Demand for fast, inexpensive, and accurate DNA sequencing data has led to the birth and dominance of a new generation of sequencing technologies. So-called "next-generation" sequencing technologies enable rapid generation of data by sequencing massive amounts of DNA in parallel using diverse methodologies which overcome the limitations of Sanger sequencing methods used to sequence the first human genome. Despite opening new frontiers of genomics research, the fundamental shift away from the Sanger sequencing that next-generation technologies has created has also left many unaware of the capabilities and applications of these new technologies, especially those in the clinical realm. Moreover, the brisk evolution of sequencing technologies has flooded the market with commercially available sequencing platforms, whose unique chemistries and diverse applications stand as another obstacle restricting the potential of next-generation sequencing. This review serves to provide a primer on next-generation sequencing technologies for clinical researchers and physician scientists. We provide an overview of the capabilities and clinical applications of DNA sequencing technologies to raise awareness among researchers about the power of these novel genomic tools. In addition, we discuss that key sequencing principles provide a comparison between existing and near-term technologies and outline key advantages and disadvantages between different sequencing platforms to help researchers choose an appropriate platform for their research interests.},

abstract = {De novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides provides essential precursors for DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. The first three steps of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis are catalyzed by a multifunctional enzyme known as CAD (carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-aspartate carbamoyltransferase-dihydroorotase). In this work, a decrease in CAD expression is detected in numerous cell lines and primary culture human stromal cells incubated under hypoxia or desferrioxamine (DFO)-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation. A putative hypoxia response element (HRE) binding matrix is identified by analyzing human cad-gene promoter using a bioinformatic approach. Promoter activity assays, using constructs harboring the cad promoter (-710/+122) and the -67/HRE fragment (25-bases), respectively, demonstrate the suppression of reporter-gene expression under hypoxia. Suppression of cad-promoter activity is substantiated by forced expression of wild-type HIF-1alpha but abolished by overexpression of dominant-negative HIF-1alpha. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay provides further evidence that HIF-1alpha binds to the cad promoter in vivo. These data demonstrate that the cad-gene expression is repressed by HIF-1alpha, which represents a functional link between hypoxia and cell-cycle arrest.},

abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a common clinical condition in which the throat narrows or collapses repeatedly during sleep, causing obstructive sleep apnoea events. The syndrome is particularly prevalent in middle-aged and older adults. The mechanism by which the upper airway collapses is not fully understood but is multifactorial and includes obesity, craniofacial changes, alteration in upper airway muscle function, pharyngeal neuropathy and fluid shift towards the neck. The direct consequences of the collapse are intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia, recurrent arousals and increase in respiratory efforts, leading to secondary sympathetic activation, oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. Excessive daytime sleepiness is a burden for the majority of patients. OSAS is also associated with cardiovascular co-morbidities, including hypertension, arrhythmias, stroke, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis and overall increased cardiovascular mortality, as well as metabolic dysfunction. Whether treating sleep apnoea can fully reverse its chronic consequences remains to be established in adequately designed studies. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the primary treatment modality in patients with severe OSAS, whereas oral appliances are also widely used in mild to moderate forms. Finally, combining different treatment modalities such as CPAP and weight control is beneficial, but need to be evaluated in randomized controlled trials.

abstract = {The effects of hypoxia on gene transcription are mainly mediated by a transcription factor complex termed hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Genetic manipulation of animals and studies of humans with rare hereditary disease have shown that modifying the HIF pathway affects systems-level physiological responses to hypoxia. It is, however, an open question whether variations in systems-level responses to hypoxia between individuals could arise from variations within the HIF system. This study sought to determine whether variations in the responsiveness of the HIF system at the cellular level could be detected between normal individuals. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were isolated on three separate occasions from each of 10 healthy volunteers. After exposure of PBL to eight different oxygen tensions ranging from 20{\%} to 0.1{\%}, the expression levels of four HIF-regulated transcripts involved in different biological pathways were measured. The profile of expression of all four transcripts in PBL was related to oxygen tension in a curvilinear manner. Double logarithmic transformation of these data resulted in a linear relationship that allowed the response to be parameterized through a gradient and intercept. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on these parameters showed that the level of between-subject variation in the gradients of the responses that was common across all four HIF-regulated transcripts was significant (P = 0.008). We conclude that statistically significant variation within the cellular response to hypoxia can be detected between normal humans. The common nature of the variability across all four HIF-regulated genes suggests that the source of this variation resides within the HIF system itself.},

@article{Romero-Ruiz2012b,
abstract = {Early adaptive responses to hypoxia are essential for cell survival, but their nature and underlying mechanisms are poorly known. We have studied the post-transcriptional changes in the proteome of mammalian cells elicited by acute hypoxia and found that phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), a ribosomal translocase whose phosphorylation inhibits protein synthesis, is under the precise and reversible control of O(2) tension. Upon exposure to hypoxia, phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr(56) occurred rapidly ({\textless}15 min) and resulted in modest translational arrest, a fundamental homeostatic response to hypoxia that spares ATP and thus facilitates cell survival. Acute inhibitory eEF2 phosphorylation occurred without ATP depletion or AMP kinase activation. Furthermore, eEF2 phosphorylation was mimicked by prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibition with dimethyloxalylglycine or by selective PHD2 siRNA silencing but was independent of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha stabilization. Moreover, overexpression of PHD2 blocked hypoxic accumulation of phosphorylated eEF2. Therefore, our findings suggest that eEF2 phosphorylation status (and, as a consequence, translation rate) is controlled by PHD2 activity. They unravel a novel pathway for cell adaptation to hypoxia that could have pathophysiologic relevance in tissue ischemia and cancer.},

abstract = {General activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathways is classically associated with adverse prognosis in cancer and has been proposed to contribute to oncogenic drive. In clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC) HIF pathways are upregulated by inactivation of the von-Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor. However HIF-1$\alpha$ and HIF-2$\alpha$ have contrasting effects on experimental tumor progression. To better understand this paradox we examined pan-genomic patterns of HIF DNA binding and associated gene expression in response to manipulation of HIF-1$\alpha$ and HIF-2$\alpha$ and related the findings to CCRC prognosis. Our findings reveal distinct pan-genomic organization of canonical and non-canonical HIF isoform-specific DNA binding at thousands of sites. Overall associations were observed between HIF-1$\alpha$-specific binding, and genes associated with favorable prognosis and between HIF-2$\alpha$-specific binding and adverse prognosis. However within each isoform-specific set, individual gene associations were heterogeneous in sign and magnitude, suggesting that activation of each HIF-$\alpha$ isoform contributes a highly complex mix of pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects.},

@article{Pescador2010a,
abstract = {When oxygen becomes limiting, cells reduce mitochondrial respiration and increase ATP production through anaerobic fermentation of glucose. The Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs) play a key role in this metabolic shift by regulating the transcription of key enzymes of glucose metabolism. Here we show that oxygen regulates the expression of the muscle glycogen synthase (GYS1). Hypoxic GYS1 induction requires HIF activity and a Hypoxia Response Element within its promoter. GYS1 gene induction correlated with a significant increase in glycogen synthase activity and glycogen accumulation in cells exposed to hypoxia. Significantly, knockdown of either HIF1alpha or GYS1 attenuated hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation, while GYS1 overexpression was sufficient to mimic this effect. Altogether, these results indicate that GYS1 regulation by HIF plays a central role in the hypoxic accumulation of glycogen. Importantly, we found that hypoxia also upregulates the expression of UTP:glucose-1-phosphate urydylyltransferase (UGP2) and 1,4-alpha glucan branching enzyme (GBE1), two enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of glycogen. Therefore, hypoxia regulates almost all the enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism in a coordinated fashion, leading to its accumulation. Finally, we demonstrated that abrogation of glycogen synthesis, by knock-down of GYS1 expression, impairs hypoxic preconditioning, suggesting a physiological role for the glycogen accumulated during chronic hypoxia. In summary, our results uncover a novel effect of hypoxia on glucose metabolism, further supporting the central importance of metabolic reprogramming in the cellular adaptation to hypoxia.},

Here we use a comprehensive study design to generate Illumina RNA-seq and Affymetrix microarray data from the same liver samples of rats exposed in triplicate to varying degrees of perturbation by 27 chemicals representing multiple modes of action (MOAs). The cross-platform concordance in terms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or enriched pathways is linearly correlated with treatment effect size (R(2)0.8). Furthermore, the concordance is also affected by transcript abundance and biological complexity of the MOA. RNA-seq outperforms microarray (93{\{}{\%}{\}} versus 75{\{}{\%}{\}}) in DEG verification as assessed by quantitative PCR, with the gain mainly due to its improved accuracy for low-abundance transcripts. Nonetheless, classifiers to predict MOAs perform similarly when developed using data from either platform. Therefore, the endpoint studied and its biological complexity, transcript abundance and the genomic application are important factors in transcriptomic research and for clinical and regulatory decision making.},

Our results reveal a complex landscape of binding, with virtually every protein analyzed possessing unique preferences. Roughly half of the proteins each recognized multiple distinctly different sequence motifs, challenging our molecular understanding of how proteins interact with their DNA binding sites.

abstract = {A graphical method is presented for displaying the patterns in a set of aligned sequences. The characters representing the sequence are stacked on top of each other for each position in the aligned sequences. The height of each letter is made proportional to its frequency, and the letters are sorted so the most common one is on top. The height of the entire stack is then adjusted to signify the information content of the sequences at that position. From these 'sequence logos', one can determine not only the consensus sequence but also the relative frequency of bases and the information content (measured in bits) at every position in a site or sequence. The logo displays both significant residues and subtle sequence patterns.},

abstract = {Humans have adapted to the chronic hypoxia of high altitude in several locations, and recent genome-wide studies have indicated a genetic basis. In some populations, genetic signatures have been identified in the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, which orchestrates the transcriptional response to hypoxia. In Tibetans, they have been found in the HIF2A (EPAS1) gene, which encodes for HIF-2$\alpha$, and the prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2, also known as EGLN1) gene, which encodes for one of its key regulators, PHD2. High-altitude adaptation may be due to multiple genes that act in concert with one another. Unraveling their mechanism of action can offer new therapeutic approaches toward treating common human diseases characterized by chronic hypoxia.},

Yet, in spite of those advances, much about the genetic basis of COPD still remains to be discovered. Unbiased approaches, such as genome-wide association (GWA) studies, are critical to identify genes and pathways and to verify suggested genetic variants. Indeed, most of our current understanding about COPD candidate genes originates from GWA studies. Experiments in form of cross-study replications and advanced meta-analyses have propelled the field towards unravelling details about COPD's pathogenesis. Here, we review the discovery of genetic variants in association with COPD phenotypes by discussing the available approaches and current findings. Limitations of current studies are considered and future directions provided.},

abstract = {Silencing of MLH1 is frequently seen in sporadic colorectal cancers. We show here that hypoxia causes decreased histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation at the MLH1 promoter via the action of the H3K4 demethylases LSD1 and PLU-1 and promotes durable long-term silencing in a pathwaythat requires LSD1. Knockdown of LSD1 or its corepressor, CoREST, also prevents the resilencing (and associated cytosine DNA methylation) of the endogenous MLH1 promoter in RKO colon cancer cells following transient reactivation by treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). The results demonstrate that hypoxia is a driving force for silencing of MLH1 and that the LSD1/CoREST complex is necessary for this process. The results reveal a mechanism by which hypoxia promotes cancer cell evolution to drive malignant progression through epigenetic modulation. Our findings suggest that LSD1/CoREST acts as a colon cancer oncogene by epigenetically silencing MLH1 and also identify the LSD1/CoREST complex as a potential target for therapy. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Hypoxia is a physiological cue that impacts diverse physiological processes, including energy metabolism, autophagy, cell motility, angiogenesis, and erythropoiesis. One of the key cell-autonomous effects of hypoxia is as a modulator of cell proliferation. For most cell types, hypoxia induces decreased cell proliferation, since an increased number of cells, with a consequent increase in O2 demand, would only exacerbate hypoxic stress. However, certain cell populations maintain cell proliferation in the face of hypoxia. This is a common pathological hallmark of cancers, but can also serve a physiological function, as in the maintenance of stem cell populations that reside in a hypoxic niche. This review will discuss major molecular mechanisms by which hypoxia regulates cell proliferation in different cell populations, with a particular focus on the role of hypoxia-inducible factors.},

abstract = {Many cancer cells are characterized by increased glycolysis and decreased respiration, even under aerobic conditions. The molecular mechanisms underlying this metabolic reprogramming are unclear. Here we show that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) negatively regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and O(2) consumption in renal carcinoma cells lacking the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL). HIF-1 mediates these effects by inhibiting C-MYC activity via two mechanisms. First, HIF-1 binds to and activates transcription of the MXI1 gene, which encodes a repressor of C-MYC transcriptional activity. Second, HIF-1 promotes MXI-1-independent, proteasome-dependent degradation of C-MYC. We demonstrate that transcription of the gene encoding the coactivator PGC-1beta is C-MYC dependent and that loss of PGC-1beta expression is a major factor contributing to reduced respiration in VHL-deficient renal carcinoma cells.},

abstract = {Rho proteins have been implicated in the regulation of multiple signal transduction processes. Some of the members of this family, including the rho gene from Aplysia californica and the human genes (rhoA, rhoB and rac-1), are proto-oncogenes since when properly mutated they can induce cell transformation, and the generated rho-transformed cells are tumorigenic when inoculated into mice. In addition to their tumorigenic activity, there is evidence suggesting that Rho proteins may contribute to the metastatic phenotype. However, all the experiments implicating Rho proteins or Rho-regulating proteins in the induction of metastatic potential are either indirect or have been performed in vitro. In this study we investigated whether cells transformed by rho oncogenes do have metastatic potential in vivo. We present evidence that cells transformed by the Aplysia californica rho gene, when injected directly into the blood stream are able to efficiently colonize lungs and secondary organs, consistent with the acquisition of the metastatic potential. Moreover, tumors derived from subcutaneous injections of these rho-transformed cells are also able to metastasize in distant organs, a strong support to the hypothesis that Rho proteins play a role in the metastatic phenotype. Finally, cells transformed by the human oncogenes dbl, vav and ost, three well-known guanine exchange factors for members of the Rho family, or cells transformed by the activated human rac-1 or rhoA genes do also have metastatic potential when injected into the blood stream. These results demonstrate that signaling pathways regulated by Rho proteins play an important role in the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype in vivo.},

abstract = {Reduction in oxygen levels below normal concentrations plays important roles in different normal and pathological conditions, such as development, tumorigenesis, chronic kidney disease and stroke. Organisms exposed to hypoxia trigger changes at both cellular and systemic levels to recover oxygen homeostasis. Most of these processes are mediated by Hypoxia Inducible Factors, HIFs, a family of transcription factors that directly induce the expression of several hundred genes in mammalian cells. Although different aspects of HIF regulation are well known, it is still unclear by which precise mechanism HIFs activate transcription of their target genes. Concomitantly, hypoxia provokes a dramatic decrease of general transcription that seems to rely in part on epigenetic changes through a poorly understood mechanism. In this review we discuss the current knowledge on chromatin changes involved in HIF dependent gene activation, as well as on other epigenetic changes, not necessarily linked to HIF that take place under hypoxic conditions.},

abstract = {Idiopathic erythrocytosis is an uncommon disease, and is defined by an increase in red blood cell mass. The differential diagnosis of erythrocytosis is extensive, and can be divided into primary and secondary forms. Primary erythrocytoses are due to intrinsic defects in erythroid precursor cells and are characterized by low erythropoietin levels. Secondary erythrocytoses are extrinsic to erythroid progenitors and are characterized by either high or inappropriately normal erythropoietin levels. A distinct subset of secondary erythrocytoses are due to genetic mutations in key proteins of the oxygen-sensing pathway. These proteins constitute the core molecular machinery of oxygen-sensing with respect to red blood cell control. Apart from assigning physiologic roles for these proteins, studies of these rare mutations have (i) revealed the exquisite sensitivity of this pathway to genetic perturbations, (ii) highlighted important functional regions of the proteins, and (iii) provided a basis for potentially targeting this pathway for therapeutic benefit. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cells adapt to environmental changes, including fluctuations in oxygen levels, through the induction of specific gene expression programs. To identify genes regulated by hypoxia at the transcriptional level, we pulse-labeled HUVEC cells with 4-thiouridine and sequenced nascent transcripts. Then, we searched genome-wide binding profiles from the ENCODE project for factors that correlated with changes in transcription and identified binding of several components of the Sin3A co-repressor complex, including SIN3A, SAP30 and HDAC1/2, proximal to genes repressed by hypoxia. SIN3A interference revealed that it participates in the downregulation of 75{\%} of the hypoxia-repressed genes in endothelial cells. Unexpectedly, it also blunted the induction of 47{\%} of the upregulated genes, suggesting a role for this corepressor in gene induction. In agreement, ChIP-seq experiments showed that SIN3A preferentially localizes to the promoter region of actively transcribed genes and that SIN3A signal was enriched in hypoxia-repressed genes, prior exposure to the stimulus. Importantly, SINA3 occupancy was not altered by hypoxia in spite of changes in H3K27ac signal. In summary, our results reveal a prominent role for SIN3A in the transcriptional response to hypoxia and suggest a model where modulation of the associated histone deacetylase activity, rather than its recruitment, determines the transcriptional output.},

A 55-year-old man presented with dyspnea and a previous diagnosis of idiopathic erythrocytosis. {\textless}italic{\textgreater}PHD{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} gene sequencing revealed a mutation on exon 2.

Our findings indicate that with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}PHD2{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} mutations there is moderate erythrocytosis and erythropoietin (Epo) levels are generally low to normal. Two patients with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}PHD2{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} substitution mutations were found to have paraganglioma and one of these patients had a concurrent pheochromocytoma. In addition, one mutation was associated with sagittal sinus thrombosis.

abstract = {Ced-4 and Apaf-1 belong to a major class of apoptosis regulators that contain caspase-recruitment (CARD) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains. Nod1, a protein with an NH2-terminal CARD-linked to a nucleotide- binding domain and a COOH-terminal segment with multiple leucine-rich repeats, was identified. Nod-1 was found to bind to multiple caspases with long prodomains, but specifically activated caspase-9 and promoted caspase- 9-induced apoptosis. As reported for Apaf-1, Nod1 required both the CARD and P-loop for function. Unlike Apaf-1, Nod1 induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-$\kappa$B) and bound RICK, a CARD-containing kinase that also induces NF-$\kappa$B activation. Nod1 mutants inhibited NF-$\kappa$B activity induced by RICK, but not that resulting from tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ stimulation. Thus, Nod1 is a leucine-rich repeat-containing Apaf-1-like molecule that can regulate both apoptosis and NF-$\kappa$B activation pathways.},

abstract = {A wide range of diseases course with an unbalance between the consumption of oxygen by tissues and its supply. This situation triggers a transcriptional response, mediated by the hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), that aims to restore oxygen homeostasis. Little is known about the inter-individual variation in this response and its role in the progression of disease. Herein, we sought to identify common genetic variants mapping to hypoxia response elements (HREs) and characterize their effect on transcription. To this end, we constructed a list of genome-wide HIF-binding regions from publicly available experimental datasets and studied the genetic variability in these regions by targeted re-sequencing of genomic samples from 96 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 144 obstructive sleep apnea patients. This study identified 14 frequent variants disrupting potential HREs. The analysis of the genomic regions containing these variants by means of reporter assays revealed that variants rs1009329, rs6593210 and rs150921338 impaired the transcriptional response to hypoxia. Finally, using genome editing we confirmed the functional role of rs6593210 in the transcriptional regulation of EGFR. In summary, we found that inter-individual variability in non-coding regions affect the response to hypoxia and could potentially impact on the progression of pulmonary diseases.},

abstract = {Hypoxia is a common environmental stress that influences signaling pathways and cell function. Several cell types, including neuroendocrine chromaffin cells, have evolved to sense oxygen levels and initiate specific adaptive responses to hypoxia. Here we report that under hypoxic conditions, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal and chemotherapy treatment. This effect is also observed after treatment with deferoxamine, a compound that mimics many of the effects of hypoxia. The hypoxia-dependent protection from apoptosis correlates with activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which is detected after 3-4 h of hypoxic or deferoxamine treatment and is sustained while hypoxic conditions are maintained. Hypoxia-induced Akt activation can be prevented by treatment with cycloheximide or actinomycin D, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is required. Finally, inhibition of PI3K impairs both the protection against apoptosis and the activation of Akt in response to hypoxia, suggesting a functional link between these two phenomena. Thus, reduced oxygen tension regulates apoptosis in PC12 cells through activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway.},

abstract = {Although the etiology of preeclampsia is still unclear, recent work suggests that changes in circulating angiogenic factors play a key role in its pathogenesis. In the trophoblast of women with preeclampsia, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1$\alpha$) is over-expressed, and induces the expression of non-angiogenic factors and inhibitors of trophoblast differentiation. This observation prompted the study of HIF-1$\alpha$ and its relation to preeclampsia. It has been described that the C1772T (P582S) and G1790A (A588T) polymorphisms of the HIF1A gene have significantly greater transcriptional activity, correlated with an increased expression of their proteins, than the wild-type sequence. In this work, we studied whether either or both HIF1A variants contribute to preeclampsia susceptibility.},

abstract = {Abstract: Hypoxia is a non-physiological level of oxygen tension, a phenomenon common in a majority of malignant tumors. Tumor-hypoxia leads to advanced but dysfunctional vascularization and acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype resulting in cell mobility and metastasis. Hypoxia alters cancer cell metabolism and contributes to therapy resistance by inducing cell quiescence. Hypoxia stimulates a complex cell signaling network in cancer cells, including the HIF, PI3K, MAPK, and NF{\$}\kappa{\$}B pathways, which interact with each other causing positive and negative feedback loops and enhancing or diminishing hypoxic effects. This review provides background knowledge on the role of tumor hypoxia and the role of the HIF cell signaling involved in tumor blood vessel formation, metastasis, and development of the resistance to therapy. Better understanding of the role of hypoxia in cancer progression will open new windows for the discovery of new therapeutics targeting hypoxic tumor cells and hypoxic microenvironment.},

abstract = {This article describes the transition from a traditional instructor-centered course, based on lectures, to a student-centered course based on active learning methodologies as part of the reform of the Spanish higher education system within the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Specifically, we describe the use of active learning methodologies to teach metabolism to students of nutrition and dietetics during the first year of their professional training in a 4-year undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Human Nutrition and Dietetics). In the new course design, the number of didactic lectures was largely reduced and complemented with a series of activities (problems/case studies, discussion workshops, self-assessment quizzes) aimed to get students actively engaged, to encourage self-learning, and to promote sustained work throughout the length of the course. The article presents quantitative data demonstrating a clear and significant improvement in students' performance when an active approach was implemented. Importantly, the improved performance was achieved without work overload. Finally, students' responses to this new teaching methodology have been very positive and overall satisfaction high. In summary, our results strongly argue in favor of the teaching model described herein.},

abstract = {In this study, we explored the existence of a transcriptional network co-regulated by E2F7 and HIF1$\alpha$, as we show that expression of E2F7, like HIF1$\alpha$, is induced in hypoxia, and because of the previously reported ability of E2F7 to interact with HIF1$\alpha$. Our genome-wide analysis uncovers a transcriptional network that is directly controlled by HIF1$\alpha$ and E2F7, and demonstrates both stimulatory and repressive functions of the HIF1$\alpha$ -E2F7 complex. Among this network we reveal Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) as a HIF1$\alpha$-E2F7 repressed gene. By performing in vitro and in vivo reporter assays we demonstrate that the HIF1$\alpha$-E2F7 mediated NRP1 repression depends on a 41 base pairs 'E2F-binding site hub', providing a molecular mechanism for a previously unanticipated role for HIF1$\alpha$ in transcriptional repression. To explore the biological significance of this regulation we performed in situ hybridizations and observed enhanced nrp1a expression in spinal motorneurons (MN) of zebrafish embryos, upon morpholino-inhibition of e2f7/8 or hif1$\alpha$ Consistent with the chemo-repellent role of nrp1a, morpholino-inhibition of e2f7/8 or hif1$\alpha$ caused MN truncations, which was rescued in TALEN-induced nrp1a(hu10012) mutants, and phenocopied in e2f7/8 mutant zebrafish. Therefore, we conclude that repression of NRP1 by the HIF1$\alpha$-E2F7 complex regulates MN axon guidance in vivo.},

abstract = {Oxygen is an essential requirement for mammalian cell metabolism. Cells respond to decreased oxygen tension by inducing adaptive responses aimed at restoring oxygen availability and maintaining energy balance. Most responses to hypoxia are mediated by the activation of a family of transcription factors termed hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF). HIF have been shown to regulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced by hypoxic cells (such as those found in a rapidly-growing tumor mass) in an effort to increase local blood flow. As such, a role has been proposed for HIF in tumor- induced angiogenesis. Recently, the central molecular mechanism involved in the control of HIF activity by oxygen has been elucidated. Interestingly, an essential component of such a mechanism is the product of the tumor suppresser gene, vhl, and which suggests that HIF activation may contribute not only to tumor progression, but also to its genesis. In this review we discuss the involvement of HIF in the development and progression of human malignancies, and its potential value as a prognostic factor and therapeutic target.},

abstract = {Mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene are responsible for a hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by high susceptibility to hemangioblastomas of the retina and central nervous system, pheochromocytomas, and renal cell carcinomas. In agreement with its role as a tumor suppressor, the vast majority of spontaneous clear cell carcinomas of the kidney present loss of heterozygosity at the VHL locus. Recently, it has been shown that VHL works as the substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiquitination complex that targets the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for proteosomal degradation. Under normal oxygen tension, the half-life of HIF transcription factors is extremely short because of its high degradation rate by the proteasome, resulting in undetectable HIF activity in normal cells. However, in VHL-deficient tumor cells, the HIF transcriptional pathway is constitutively activated because of impaired ubiquitination of this transcription factor. To target VHL-deficient tumors, we have exploited this feature to develop a conditionally replicative adenovirus (Ad9xHRE1A), the replication of which is HIF dependent. In this new oncolytic adenovirus, the expression of the E1A gene is controlled by an optimized minimal promoter containing HIF recognition elements. Here, we show that the induction of the E1A gene, as well as the viral replication and cytolytic effect of Ad9xHRE1A, are dependent on HIF activity. As a consequence, this virus efficiently kills VHL-deficient cells both in vitro and in vivo, as well as cells growing under hypoxic conditions. These data suggest that Ad9xHRE1A could be used as a highly specific therapy for VHL-deficient cancers and probably many other tumors that show extensive hypoxic areas or increased HIF activity by genetic alterations other than VHL loss.},

abstract = {Sleep-disordered breathing is a common disorder with a range of harmful sequelae. Obesity is a strong causal factor for sleep-disordered breathing, and because of the ongoing obesity epidemic, previous estimates of sleep-disordered breathing prevalence require updating. We estimated the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in the United States for the periods of 1988-1994 and 2007-2010 using data from the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study, an ongoing community-based study that was established in 1988 with participants randomly selected from an employed population of Wisconsin adults. A total of 1,520 participants who were 30-70 years of age had baseline polysomnography studies to assess the presence of sleep-disordered breathing. Participants were invited for repeat studies at 4-year intervals. The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was modeled as a function of age, sex, and body mass index, and estimates were extrapolated to US body mass index distributions estimated using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The current prevalence estimates of moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing (apnea-hypopnea index, measured as events/hour, ≥15) are 10{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 7, 12) among 30-49-year-old men; 17{\%} (95{\%} CI: 15, 21) among 50-70-year-old men; 3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2, 4) among 30-49-year-old women; and 9{\%} (95{\%} CI: 7, 11) among 50-70 year-old women. These estimated prevalence rates represent substantial increases over the last 2 decades (relative increases of between 14{\%} and 55{\%} depending on the subgroup).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays a key role in cellular adaptation to hypoxia. To better understand the determinants of HIF-1 binding and transactivation, we used ChIP-chip and gene expression profiling to define the relationship between the epigenetic landscape, sites of HIF-1 binding, and genes transactivated by hypoxia in two cell lines. RESULTS: We found that when cells were acutely subjected to hypoxia, HIF-1 preferentially bound to loci that were already transcriptionally active under normal growth conditions characterized by the presence of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation, the presence of RNA polymerase II, and basal production of mRNA. Cell type-specific differences in HIF-1 binding were largely attributable to differences in the basal gene expression patterns in the cells prior to the onset of hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the repertoire of genes active in a cell (for example, through lineage specific transcription factors) defines the subset of genes that are permissive for binding and transactivation by stimulus-responsive transcription factors.},

abstract = {Lipid-derived metabolites play an important role in the regulation of cell responses to external stimuli, including cell growth control, transformation and apoptosis. Phospholipase D (PLD) is one of the critical elements in the regulation of lipid metabolism and the generation of second messengers, some of them involved in cell growth control. Oncogenic Ras proteins affect the activity of PLD by two alternate mechanisms, involving a positive activation and a feedback negative loop. Here we investigate the involvement of the proto-oncogenic Ras protein in the physiological activation of PLD induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Over-expression of the wild type Ras protein or some of its regulatory components, such as Shc or Grb2, induces an amplification of PLD activation by PDGF challenge. Furthermore, blocking the endogenous Ras by expression of the dominant negative mutant, H-Ras-Asn17 completely eliminated the activation of PLD by PDGF. Thus, PDGF requires a complex system for PLD regulation implying the existence of at least two positive regulatory pathways, a Ras-dependent and a PKC-dependent mechanism. These results imply that PLD is an important element in signaling by Ras proteins that is altered after ras-induced transformation.},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that pathway-specific transcriptional activators recruit pleiotropic coactivators (such as chromatin-modifying complexes or general transcription factors), while specific repressors contact pleiotropic corepressors creating an inaccessible chromatin by the action of histone deacetylases. We have previously shown that the negative regulator Opi1 of yeast phospholipid biosynthesis inhibits transcription by recruiting corepressors Sin3 and Cyc8 in the presence of precursor molecules inositol and choline. To get access to its target genes, Opi1 physically contacts and counteracts DNA-bound activator Ino2. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that Sin3 and Cyc8 can be detected at Opi1 target promoters INO1 and CHO2 under repressing and derepressing conditions and that corepressor binding is effective even in the absence of Opi1, while Ino2 is absolutely required. Thus, corepressors may be recruited not only by repressors but also by activators such as Ino2. Indeed, we could demonstrate direct interaction of Ino2 with Sin3 and Cyc8. The Opi1 repressor interaction domain within Ino2 is also able to contact Sin3 and Cyc8. Recruitment of corepressors by an activator is not a regulatory exception as we could show that activators Pho4 and Hac1 also contain domains being able to interact with Sin3 and Cyc8.},

abstract = {Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is at the basis of renal transplantation and acute kidney injury. Molecular mechanisms underlying proximal tubule response to I/R will allow the identification of new therapeutic targets for both clinical settings. microRNAs have emerged as crucial and tight regulators of the cellular response to insults including hypoxia. Here, we have identified several miRNAs involved in the response of the proximal tubule cell to I/R. Microarrays and RT-PCR analysis of proximal tubule cells submitted to I/R mimicking conditions in vitro demonstrated that miR-127 is induced during ischemia and also during reperfusion. miR-127 is also modulated in a rat model of renal I/R. Interference approaches demonstrated that ischemic induction of miR-127 is mediated by Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1alpha (HIF-1$\alpha$) stabilization. Moreover, miR-127 is involved in cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion maintenance, since overexpression of miR-127 maintains focal adhesion complex assembly and the integrity of tight junctions. miR-127 also regulates intracellular trafficking since miR-127 interference promotes dextran-FITC uptake. In fact, we have identified the Kinesin Family Member 3B (KIF3B), involved in cell trafficking, as a target of miR-127 in rat proximal tubule cells. In summary, we have described a novel role of miR-127 in cell adhesion and its regulation by HIF-1$\alpha$. We also identified for the first time KIF3B as a miR-127 target. Both, miR-127 and KIF3B appear as key mediators of proximal epithelial tubule cell response to I/R with potential al application in renal ischemic damage management. {\textcopyright} 2012 Aguado-Fraile et al.},

abstract = {Low oxygen levels induce an adaptive response in cells through the activation of HIFs (hypoxia-inducible factors). These transcription factors are mainly regulated by a group of proline hydroxylases that, in the presence of oxygen, target HIF for degradation. The expression of two such enzymes, EGLN1 [EGL nine homologous protein 1, where EGL stands for egg laying defective (Caenorhabditis elegans gene)] and EGLN3, is induced by hypoxia through a negative feedback loop, and we have demonstrated recently that hypoxic induction of EGLN expression is HIF-dependent. In the present study, we have identified an HRE (hypoxia response element) in the region of the EGLN3 gene using a combination of bioinformatics and biological approaches. Initially, we isolated a number of HRE consensus sequences in a region of 40 kb around the human EGLN3 gene and studied their evolutionary conservation. Subsequently, we examined the functionality of the conserved HRE sequences in reporter and chromatin precipitation assays. One of the HREs, located within a conserved region of the first intron of the EGLN3 gene 12 kb downstream of the transcription initiation site, bound HIF in vivo. Furthermore, this sequence was able to drive reporter gene expression under conditions of hypoxia in an HRE-dependent manner. Indeed, we were able to demonstrate that HIF was necessary and sufficient to induce gene expression from this enhancer sequence.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) controls an extensive range of adaptive responses to hypoxia. To better understand this transcriptional cascade we performed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation using antibodies to two major HIF-$\alpha$ subunits, and correlated the results with genome-wide transcript profiling. Within a tiled promoter array we identified 546 and 143 sequences that bound, respectively, to HIF-1$\alpha$ or HIF-2$\alpha$ at high stringency. Analysis of these sequences confirmed an identical core binding motif for HIF-1$\alpha$ and HIF-2$\alpha$ (RCGTG) but demonstrated that binding to this motif was highly selective, with binding enriched at distinct regions both upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start. Comparison of HIF-promoter binding data with bidirectional HIF-dependent changes in transcript expression indicated that whereas a substantial proportion of positive responses ({\textgreater}20{\%} across all significantly regulated genes) are direct, HIF-dependent gene suppression is almost entirely indirect. Comparison of HIF-1$\alpha$- versus HIF-2$\alpha$-binding sites revealed that whereas some loci bound HIF-1$\alpha$ in isolation, many bound both isoforms with similar affinity. Despite high-affinity binding to multiple promoters, HIF-2$\alpha$ contributed to few, if any, of the transcriptional responses to acute hypoxia at these loci. Given emerging evidence for biologically distinct functions of HIF-1$\alpha$ versus HIF-2$\alpha$ understanding the mechanisms restricting HIF-2$\alpha$ activity will be of interest.},

Illumina gene microarrays were performed with subsequent verification by real-time PCR. Pro-inflammatory cytokines in the media were measured by ELISA. Both IH and SH-4{\%} up-regulated pro-inflammatory genes, including heat shock protein 90 kDa B1, tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 4 and thrombospondin 1. Among all pro-inflammatory genes, only IL-8 mRNA showed significantly higher levels of expression (1.78 fold) during IH, compared to SH-4{\%}, but both types of hypoxic exposure elicited striking 3-8 fold increases in IL-8 and IL-6 protein levels in the media. IH and SH-4{\%} also up-regulated antioxidant genes, including heme oxygenase 1 and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), whereas classical genes regulated by hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), such as endothelin and glucose transporter GLUT1, were not induced. SH-8{\%} induced changes in gene expression and cytokine secretion, which were similar to IH and SH-4{\%}. In conclusion, short exposure to IH and SH up-regulates pro-inflammatory and antioxidant genes in HAEC and increases secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-6 into the media in a similar fashion. Key words: hypoxia, gene microarrays, interleukin 8, interleukin 6.},

abstract = {Most of the genes induced by hypoxia are regulated by a family of transcription factors termed hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF). Under normoxic conditions, HIFalpha proteins are very unstable due to hydroxylation by a recently described family of proline hydroxylases termed EGL-Nine homologs (EGLN). Upon hydroxylation, HIFalpha is recognized by the product of the tumor suppressor vhl and targeted for proteosomal degradation. Since EGLNs require oxygen to catalyze HIF hydroxylation, this reaction does not efficiently occur under low oxygen tension. Thus, under hypoxia, HIFalpha escapes from degradation and transcribes target genes. The mRNA levels of two of the three EGLNs described to date are induced by hypoxia, suggesting that they might be novel HIF target genes; however, no proof for this hypothesis has been reported. Here we show that the induction of EGLN1 and -3 by hypoxia is found in a wide range of cell types. The basal levels of EGLN3 are always well below those of EGLN1 and EGLN2, and its induction by hypoxia is larger than that found for EGLN1. The inhibitor of transcription, actinomycin D, prevents the increase of EGLN3 mRNA induced by hypoxia, indicating that it is due to enhanced gene expression. Interestingly, EGLN1 and EGLN3 mRNAs were also triggered by EGLN inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of HIFalpha in the control of its transcription. In agreement with this possibility, pVHL-deficient cell lines, which present high HIF activity under normoxia, also showed dramatically increased normoxic levels of EGLN3. Moreover, the overexpression of an oxygen-insensitive mutant form of HIFalpha resulted in increased normoxic levels of EGLN3 mRNA. Finally, hypoxic induction of EGLNs was not observed in cells lacking functional HIFalpha.},

abstract = {Phospholipase D (PLD) is activated by a variety of stimuli, including mitogenic stimulation by growth factors and oncogene transformation. Activation of PLD by growth factors requires protein kinase C (PKC) since depletion of the enzyme by down-regulation or direct inhibition by specific drugs completely abrogates this effect. Transformation by the ras and src oncogenes is also associated with an increase in basal PLD activity. However, this effect is not dependent on PKC, suggesting that growth factors and oncogenes may activate PLD by two independent mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that activation of PLD by phorbol esters is greatly enhanced in ras-transformed cells, suggesting synergistic activation of PLD by ras oncogenes and PKC. Also, ras-transformed cells showed a dramatic attenuation of the PLD activation induced by growth factors, although receptor function was still detectable. This attenuation paralleled the specific uncoupling of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) pathway, indicating that activation of PLD by growth factors may be mediated by PI-PLC and PKC activation. Attenuation of PLD activation by platelet-derived growth factor was also observed in several oncogene-transformed cells, as well as the uncoupling of the PI-PLC pathway. Neither the co-operation with PKC activation nor the attenuation of the PLD response to growth factors in ras-transformed cells was a general consequence of cell transformation, since cells transformed by other oncogenes showed a normal response to either treatment. These results support the existence of at least two alternative signalling routes for the activation of PLD, one mediated by the PI-PLC/diacylglycerol/PKC pathway and a second one mediated by several oncogenes, independent of the PKC pathway, which synergizes with the PI-PLC/PKC-dependent pathway.},

abstract = {Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a member of the serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) superfamily, displays a potent antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activity in a broad range of tumor types. Melanocytes and low aggressive melanoma cells secrete high levels of PEDF, while its expression is lost in highly aggressive melanomas. PEDF efficiently abrogates a number of functional properties critical for the acquisition of metastatic ability by melanoma cells, such as neovascularization, proliferation, migration, invasiveness and extravasation. In this study, we identify hypoxia as a relevant negative regulator of PEDF in melanocytes and low aggressive melanoma cells. PEDF was regulated at the protein level. Importantly, although downregulation of PEDF was induced by inhibition of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, it was independent of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), a key mediator of the adaptation to hypoxia. Decreased PEDF protein was not mediated by inhibition of translation through untranslated regions (UTRs) in melanoma cells. Degradation by metalloproteinases, implicated on PEDF degradation in retinal pigment epithelial cells, or by the proteasome, was also excluded as regulatory mechanism in melanoma cells. Instead, we found that degradation by autophagy was critical for PEDF downregulation under hypoxia in human melanoma cells. Our findings show that hypoxic conditions encountered during primary melanoma growth downregulate antiangiogenic and antimetastasic PEDF by a posttranslational mechanism involving degradation by autophagy and could therefore contribute to the acquisition of highly metastatic potential characteristic of aggressive melanoma cells.},

abstract = {In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the apoptotic machinery is composed of four basic elements: the caspase CED-3, the Apaf-1 homologue CED-4, and the Bcl-2 family members CED-9 and EGL-1. The ced-9(n1950) gain-of-function mutation prevents most, if not all, somatic cell deaths in C. elegans. It encodes a CED-9 protein with a glycine-to-glutamate substitution at position 169, which is located within the highly conserved Bcl-2 homology 1 domain. We performed biochemical analyses with the CED-9G169E protein to gain insight into the mechanism of programmed cell death. We find that CED-9G169E retains the ability to bind both EGL-1 and CED-4, although its affinity for EGL-1 is reduced. In contrast to the behavior of wild-type CED-9, the interaction between CED-9G169E and CED-4 is not disrupted by expression of EGL-1. Furthermore, CED-4 and CED-9G169E co-localizes with EGL-1 to the mitochondria in mammalian cells, and expression of EGL-1 does not induce translocation of CED-4 to the cytosol. Finally, the ability of EGL-1 to promote apoptosis is impaired by the replacement of wild-type CED-9 with CED-9G169E, and this effect is correlated with the inability of EGL-1 to induce the displacement of CED-4 from the CED-9.CED-4 complex. These studies suggest that the release of CED-4 from the CED-9.CED-4 complex is a necessary step for induction of programmed cell death in C. elegans.},

Analysis of the ChIP-Seq regions is now a central component in gene regulation studies. The need remains strong for methods to improve the interpretation of ChIP-Seq data and the study of specific TF binding sites (TFBS).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We introduce a set of methods to improve the interpretation of ChIP-Seq data, including the inference of mediating TFs based on TFBS motif over-representation analysis and the subsequent study of spatial distribution of TFBSs. TFBS over-representation analysis applied to ChIP-Seq data is used to detect which TFBSs arise more frequently than expected by chance. Visualization of over-representation analysis results with new composition-bias plots reveals systematic bias in over-representation scores. We introduce the BiasAway background generating software to resolve the problem. A heuristic procedure based on topological motif enrichment relative to the ChIP-Seq peaks' local maximums highlights peaks likely to be directly bound by a TF of interest. The results suggest that on average two-thirds of a ChIP-Seq dataset's peaks are bound by the ChIP'd TF; the origin of the remaining peaks remaining undetermined. Additional visualization methods allow for the study of both inter-TFBS spatial relationships and motif-flanking sequence properties, as demonstrated in case studies for TBP and ZNF143/THAP11.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Topological properties of TFBS within ChIP-Seq datasets can be harnessed to better interpret regulatory sequences. Using GC content corrected TFBS over-representation analysis, combined with visualization techniques and analysis of the topological distribution of TFBS, we can distinguish peaks likely to be directly bound by a TF. The new methods will empower researchers for exploration of gene regulation and TF binding.},

This restricted set of targets is in sharp contrast with the widespread distribution of the HIF binding motif throughout the genome. Here, we investigated the transcriptional response of GYS1 and RUVBL2 genes to hypoxia to understand the mechanisms that restrict HIF activity toward specific genes. GYS1 and RUVBL2 genes are encoded by opposite DNA strands and separated by a short intergenic region ({\{}{\~{}}{\}}1 kb) that contains a functional hypoxia response element equidistant to both genes. However, hypoxia induced the expression of GYS1 gene only. Analysis of the transcriptional response of chimeric constructs derived from the intergenic region revealed an inhibitory sequence whose deletion allowed RUVBL2 induction by HIF. Enhancer blocking assays, performed in cell culture and transgenic zebrafish, confirmed the existence of an insulator element within this inhibitory region that could explain the differential regulation of GYS1 and RUVBL2 by hypoxia. Hence, in this model, the selective response to HIF is achieved with the aid of insulator elements. This is the first report suggesting a role for insulators in the regulation of differential gene expression in response to environmental signals.},

Despite recent characterization of genome-wide HIF DNA binding locations and hypoxia-regulated transcripts in different cell types, the molecular bases of HIF target selection remain unresolved. Herein, we combined multi-level experimental data and computational predictions to identify sequence motifs that may contribute to HIF target selectivity. We obtained a core set of bona fide HIF binding regions by integrating multiple HIF1 DNA binding and hypoxia expression profiling datasets. This core set exhibits evolutionarily conserved binding regions and is enriched in functional responses to hypoxia. Computational prediction of enriched transcription factor binding sites identified sequence motifs corresponding to several stress-responsive transcription factors, such as activator protein 1 (AP1), cAMP response element-binding (CREB), or CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (CEBP). Experimental validations on HIF-regulated promoters suggest a functional role of the identified motifs in modulating HIF-mediated transcription. Accordingly, transcriptional targets of these factors are over-represented in a sorted list of hypoxia-regulated genes. Altogether, our results implicate cooperativity among stress-responsive transcription factors in fine-tuning the HIF transcriptional response.},

@article{Alcaide-German2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several human pathologies, including neoplasia and ischemic cardiovascular diseases, course with an unbalance between oxygen supply and demand (hypoxia). Cells within hypoxic regions respond with the induction of a specific genetic program, under the control of the Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF), that mediates their adaptation to the lack of oxygen. The activity of HIF is mainly regulated by the EGL-nine homolog (EGLN) enzymes that hydroxylate the alpha subunit of this transcription factor in an oxygen-dependent reaction. Hydroxylated HIF is then recognized and ubiquitinilated by the product of the tumor suppressor gene, pVHL, leading to its proteosomal degradation. Under hypoxia, the hydroxylation of HIF by the EGLNs is compromised due to the lack of oxygen, which is a reaction cosubstrate. Thus, HIF escapes degradation and drives the transcription of its target genes. Since the progression of the aforementioned pathologies might be influenced by activation of HIF-target genes, development of small molecules with the ability to interfere with the HIF-regulatory machinery is of great interest. RESULTS: Herein we describe a yeast three-hybrid system that reconstitutes mammalian HIF regulation by the EGLNs and VHL. In this system, yeast growth, under specific nutrient restrictions, is driven by the interaction between the beta domain of VHL and a hydroxyproline-containing HIFalpha peptide. In turn, this interaction is strictly dependent on EGLN activity that hydroxylates the HIFalpha peptide. Importantly, this system accurately preserves the specificity of the hydroxylation reaction toward specific substrates. We propose that this system, in combination with a matched control, can be used as a simple and inexpensive assay to identify molecules that specifically modulate EGLN activity. As a proof of principle we show that two known EGLN inhibitors, dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) and 6-chlor-3-hydroxychinolin-2-carbonic acid-N-carboxymethylamide (S956711), have a profound and specific effect on the yeast HIF/EGLN/VHL system. CONCLUSION: The system described in this work accurately reconstitutes HIF regulation while preserving EGLN substrate specificity. Thus, it is a valuable tool to study HIF regulation, and particularly EGLN biochemistry, in a cellular context. In addition, we demonstrate that this system can be used to identify specific inhibitors of the EGLN enzymes.},

abstract = {Transformation by ras oncogenes induces the deregulation of intracellular signalling cascades that are critical elements in cell growth control. Ras proteins are molecular switches with the ability to interact and activate several effector molecules. Among those, Raf-1 kinase, PI3K and Ral-GDS are the best characterised. Raf activates the mitogenic MEK/ERK kinases pathway, while PI3K regulates the PKB/Akt cascade, involved in the control of proliferation, metabolism and apoptotic responses. Finally, Ral-GDS belongs to a family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors that activate Ral GTPases. While Raf and PI3K have emerged as critical elements in regulating cell growth and apoptosis, little is known about the role of the Ral-GDS family. We have previously reported that Ras proteins are critical elements in the regulation of phospholipase D (PLD), a proposed target for the Ral-GDS/RalA pathway. Physiological regulation of PLD by growth factors requires the simultaneous activation of the endogenous, wild-type Ras proteins, and a PKC-dependent mechanism. Transformation by ras oncogenes induces drastic alterations in PLD activity and the usual response to external stimuli, through a PKC-independent mechanism. Here we provide further evidence on the mechanisms by which oncogenic Ras proteins induces the deregulation of PLD and here we try to identify the specific effectors involved. A complex system for PLD regulation is unravelled which implies the existence of two positive regulatory pathways, mediated by Ral-GDS and PI3K, and two negative feedback mechanisms mediated by Raf and Ral-GDS. These results strongly support participation of PLD in Ras-mediated signalling. Furthermore, we provide evidence that oncogenic Ras proteins constitutively activate PLD by mechanisms different to those used by normal Ras proteins.},

HIF$\alpha$ contains two independent oxygen degradation domains (N-ODD and C-ODD) that are substrates for these enzymes. In this work, we employed the yeast two-hybrid assay to study the sequence determinants required for the binding of EGLN1 and 3 to HIF1$\alpha$ in a cellular context. Our results demonstrate that, while EGLN1 is able to recognize both ODDs within full length HIF1$\alpha$ protein, EGLN3 only binds to CODD. The analysis of the residue substitutions within CODD uncovered novel critical determinants for EGLN1 and 3 binding. In addition, our results show that both enzymes have a very similar, albeit not identical, residue preference at specific positions in their substrate sequences. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {HIFs [hypoxia-inducible (transcription) factors] are essential for the induction of an adaptive gene expression programme under low oxygen partial pressure. The activity of these transcription factors is mainly determined by the stability of the HIFalpha subunit, which is regulated, in an oxygen-dependent manner, by a family of three prolyl 4-hydroxylases [EGLN1-EGLN3 (EGL nine homologues 1-3)]. HIFalpha contains two, N- and C-terminal, independent ODDs (oxygen-dependent degradation domains), namely NODD and CODD, that, upon hydroxylation by the EGLNs, target HIFalpha for proteasomal degradation. In vitro studies indicate that each EGLN shows a differential preference for ODDs, However, the sequence determinants for such specificity are unknown. In the present study we showed that whereas EGLN1 and EGLN2 acted upon any of these ODDs to regulate HIF1alpha protein levels and activity in vivo, EGLN3 only acted on the CODD. With the aim of identifying the region within EGLNs responsible for their differential substrate preference, we investigated the activity and binding pattern of different EGLN deletions and chimaeric constructs generated by domain swapping between EGLN1 and EGLN3. These studies revealed a region of 97 residues that was sufficient to confer the characteristic substrate binding observed for each EGLN. Within this region, we identified the minimal sequence (EGLN1 residues 236-252) involved in substrate discrimination. Importantly, mapping of these sequences on the EGLN1 tertiary structure indicates that substrate specificity is determined by a region relatively remote from the catalytic site.},

@article{Naranjo-Suarez2003,
abstract = {Cellular responses to low oxygen tension are mediated, at least in part, by the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). In the presence of oxygen, specific HIF residues become hydroxylated by the action of a recently described group of dioxygenases. These post-translational modifications target HIF for proteosomal degradation and prevent its transcriptional activity. Despite these detailed studies, little is known about the regulation of HIF by stimuli other than hypoxia. Here we report that, in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation results in a decrease of both basal and hypoxia-induced levels of HIF-2 alpha protein. NGF treatment did not increase HIF-hydroxylase gene expression or activity, and the reduction of the HIF-2 alpha protein level upon stimulation was observed even in the presence of HIF-hydroxylase inhibitors such as deferoxamine or dimethyloxoglutarate. Thus, in contrast to the response to hypoxia, the effect of NGF on HIF-2 alpha protein levels is not mediated by the HIF hydroxilases. Quantitative real time (RT)-PCR showed that NGF stimulation results in a decrease of the HIF-2 alpha mRNA level similar to that found at the protein level. Interestingly, NGF effect was specific for HIF-2 alpha mRNA because it did not affect HIF-1 alpha mRNA levels. NGF treatment reduced HIF-2 alpha mRNA levels even in the presence of actinomycin D, suggesting an effect on mRNA stability. Finally, the effect of NGF on HIF2 alpha correlates with reduction of both basal and hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA levels. Reporter assays suggest that the reduced expression of hypoxia-inducible genes upon NGF treatment is related, at least in part, to the reduction of HIF-2 alpha protein. Hence, in PC12 cells the level of HIF-2 alpha protein and its effect on gene expression can be down-regulated by stimuli other than oxygen.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) belong to an evolutionary conserved family of transcription factors, the activity of which is tightly regulated by oxygen levels. We have recently demonstrated that hypoxia activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in some cell types, and other works have suggested that this pathway is involved in the activation of HIF. In the present work we studied the role of this pathway in the induction of HIF by hypoxia. Under hypoxic conditions the PI3K/Akt pathway was activated in some (PC12 and HeLa) but not all cell types (HepG2) tested, whereas the HIF protein was induced by hypoxia in all cases. Kinetics analysis showed that, when observed, the activation of PI3K/Akt occurred after HIF induction. In addition, the chemical inhibition of PI3K had no significant effect on the induction of the HIF protein or its transcriptional activity but prevented Akt activation. Accordingly, transient overexpression of a dominant negative form of the regulatory subunit of PI3K in HEK293T cells did not interfere with the induction of the HIF-alpha protein by hypoxia or affect HIF-mediated transcription in any of the cell types tested. Moreover, forced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway did not affect the transcriptional activity of HIF under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Thus, our data suggest that the activation of PI3K/Akt by hypoxia is cell type-specific and, when observed, lies downstream of HIF activation or in a parallel pathway. Furthermore, the activity of the PI3K/Akt is not sufficient for the activation of HIF nor is it essential for its induction by hypoxia.},

RICK physically interacts with CLARP, a caspase-like molecule known to bind to Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and caspase-8. Expression of RICK promoted the activation of caspase-8 and potentiated apoptosis induced by Fas ligand, FADD, CLARP, and caspase-8. Deletion mutant analysis revealed that both the kinase domain and caspase-recruitment domain were required for RICK to promote apoptosis. Significantly, expression of a RICK mutant in which the lysine of the putative ATP-binding site at position 38 was replaced by a methionine functioned as an inhibitor of CD95-mediated apoptosis. Thus, RICK represents a novel kinase that may regulate apoptosis induced by the CD95/Fas receptor pathway.},

abstract = {The transcriptional response driven by Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is central to the adaptation to oxygen restriction. Hence, the complete identification of HIF targets is essential for understanding the cellular responses to hypoxia. Herein we describe a computational strategy based on the combination of phylogenetic footprinting and transcription profiling meta-analysis for the identification of HIF-target genes. Comparison of the resulting candidates with published HIF1a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation indicates a high sensitivity (78{\%}) and specificity (97.8{\%}). To validate our strategy, we performed HIF1a chromatin immunoprecipitation on a set of putative targets. Our results confirm the robustness of the computational strategy in predicting HIF-binding sites and reveal several novel HIF targets, including RE1-silencing transcription factor co-repressor (RCOR2). In addition, mapping of described polymorphisms to the predicted HIF-binding sites identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could alter HIF binding. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that SNP rs17004038, mapping to a functional hypoxia response element in the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) locus, prevents induction of this gene by hypoxia. Altogether, our results show that the proposed strategy is a powerful tool for the identification of HIF direct targets that expands our knowledge of the cellular adaptation to hypoxia and provides cues on the inter-individual variation in this response.},

abstract = {BAD is a distant member of the Bcl-2 family that promotes cell death. Phosphorylation of BAD prevents this. BAD phosphorylation induced by interleukin-3 (IL-3) was inhibited by specific inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Akt, a survival-promoting serine-threonine protein kinase, was activated by IL-3 in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Active, but not inactive, forms of Akt were found to phosphorylate BAD in vivo and in vitro at the same residues that are phosphorylated in response to IL-3. Thus, the proapoptotic function of BAD is regulated by the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a master regulator of adaptive gene expression under hypoxia. However, a role for HIF1 in the epigenetic regulation remains unknown. Genome-wide analysis of HIF1 binding sites (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] with deep sequencing) of endothelial cells clarified that HIF1 mainly binds to the intergenic regions distal from transcriptional starting sites under both normoxia and hypoxia. Next, we examined the temporal profile of gene expression under hypoxic conditions by using DNA microarrays. We clarified that early hypoxia-responsive genes are functionally associated with glycolysis, including GLUT3 (SLC2A3). Acetylated lysine 27 of histone 3 covered the HIF1 binding sites, and HIF1 functioned as an enhancer of SLC2A3 by interaction with lysine (K)-specific demethylase 3A (KDM3A). Knockdown of HIF1$\alpha$ and KDM3A showed that glycolytic genes are regulated by both HIF1 and KDM3A and respond to hypoxia in a manner independent of cell type specificity. We elucidated that both the chromatin conformational structure and histone modification change under hypoxic conditions and enhance the expression of SLC2A3 based on the combined results of chromatin conformation capture (3C) and ChIP assays. KDM3A is recruited to the SLC2A3 locus in an HIF1-dependent manner and demethylates H3K9me2 so as to upregulate its expression. These findings provide novel insights into the interaction between HIF1 and KDM3A and also the epigenetic regulation of HIF1.},

abstract = {Repressors, polymerases, ribosomes and other macromolecules bind to specific nucleic acid sequences. They can find a binding site only if the sequence has a recognizable pattern. We define a measure of the information (R sequence) in the sequence patterns at binding sites. It allows one to investigate how information is distributed across the sites and to compare one site to another. One can also calculate the amount of information (R frequency) that would be required to locate the sites, given that they occur with some frequency in the genome. Several Escherichia coli binding sites were analyzed using these two independent empirical measurements. The two amounts of information are similar for most of the sites we analyzed. In contrast, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase binding sites contain about twice as much information as is necessary for recognition by the T7 polymerase, suggesting that a second protein may bind at T7 promoters. The extra information can be accounted for by a strong symmetry element found at the T7 promoters. This element may be an operator. If this model is correct, these promoters and operators do not share much information. The comparisons between R sequence and R frequency suggest that the information at binding sites is just sufficient for the sites to be distinguished from the rest of the genome.},

abstract = {Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) homodimeric transactivator, which induces itself and several lipogenic enzymes, notably fatty acid synthase (FAS). We demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) represses the SREBP-1c gene by inducing Stimulated with retinoic acid (Stra)13/Differentiated embryo chondrocyte 1(DEC1) and its isoform, DEC2. Stra13/DEC1 and DEC2 are bHLH homodimeric transcription repressors. We found that both Stra13 and DEC2 inhibit SREBP-1c-induced transcription by competing with SREBP-1c for binding to the E-box in the SREBP-1c promoter and/or by interacting with SREBP-1c protein. DEC2 is instantly and temporarily induced in acute hypoxia, while Stra13 is induced in prolonged hypoxia. This expression profile reflects the finding that Stra13 represses DEC2, thus maintains low level of DEC2 in prolonged hypoxia. DEC2-siRNA restores the hypoxic repression but Stra13-siRNA fails to do so, suggesting that DEC2 is the major initiator of hypoxic repression of SREBP-1c, whereas Stra13 substitutes for DEC2 in prolonged hypoxia. Our findings imply that Stra13 and DEC2 are the mediators to repress SREBP-1c gene in response to hypoxia. By doing so, HIF and its targets, Stra13 and DEC2 reduce the ATP consuming anabolic lipogenesis prior to the actual decrease of ATP acting as a feed-forward mechanism.},

abstract = {In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, programmed cell death is implemented by the protease CED-3 whose activity is inhibited by CED-9 through physical associations with the regulator CED-4. The product of a recently described gene, egl-1, binds to and inhibits CED-9. In the present studies, we have addressed the molecular mechanism by which EGL-1 regulates CED-9 function and promotes cell death. Expression of CED-4 and CED-3 resulted in decreased survival and apoptosis of mammalian cells, activities that could be inhibited by CED-9. Importantly, this protective effect of CED- 9 was antagonized by EGL-1. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that EGL-1 binding to CED-9 disrupts the association between CED-4 and CED-9, an activity that required the BH3 motif of EGL-1. Consistent with these results, expression of EGL-1 promoted CED-4-dependent processing of CED-3, and this activity of EGL-1 was mediated through inhibition of CED-9. In mammalian cells, CED-9 is known to target the subcellular localization of CED-4 from the cytosol to intracellular membranes. Expression of EGL-1 resulted in redistribution of CED-4 from intracellular membranes, where it co-localized with CED-9, to the cytoplasm, providing further evidence that EGL-1 regulates CED-4 through CED-9. Finally, the levels of EGL-1 were greatly enhanced by coexpression of CED-9 in both mammalian cells and in a cell-free system, suggesting a role for CED-9 in the expression and/or stabilization of EGL-1. These studies provide a mechanism for how EGL-1 functions to antagonize pro- survival of CED-9 and to promote CED-3 activation and programmed cell death.},

We sequenced 50 exomes of ethnic Tibetans, encompassing coding sequences of 92{\%} of human genes, with an average coverage of 18x per individual. Genes showing population-specific allele frequency changes, which represent strong candidates for altitude adaptation, were identified. The strongest signal of natural selection came from endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (EPAS1), a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia. One single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at EPAS1 shows a 78{\%} frequency difference between Tibetan and Han samples, representing the fastest allele frequency change observed at any human gene to date. This SNP's association with erythrocyte abundance supports the role of EPAS1 in adaptation to hypoxia. Thus, a population genomic survey has revealed a functionally important locus in genetic adaptation to high altitude.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex diseases, but mechanistic insights are impeded by a lack of understanding of how specific risk variants functionally contribute to the underlying pathogenesis. It has been proposed that cis-acting effects of non-coding risk variants on gene expression are a major factor for phenotypic variation of complex traits and disease susceptibility. Recent genome-scale epigenetic studies have highlighted the enrichment of GWAS-identified variants in regulatory DNA elements of disease-relevant cell types. Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-specific changes in transcription factor binding are correlated with heritable alterations in chromatin state and considered a major mediator of sequence-dependent regulation of gene expression. Here we describe a novel strategy to functionally dissect the cis-acting effect of genetic risk variants in regulatory elements on gene expression by combining genome-wide epigenetic information with clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells. By generating a genetically precisely controlled experimental system, we identify a common Parkinson's disease associated risk variant in a non-coding distal enhancer element that regulates the expression of {\$}\alpha{\$}-synuclein (SNCA), a key gene implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Our data suggest that the transcriptional deregulation of SNCA is associated with sequence-dependent binding of the brain-specific transcription factors EMX2 and NKX6-1. This work establishes an experimental paradigm to functionally connect genetic variation with disease-relevant phenotypes.},

abstract = {The oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of proline residues in the ?? subunit of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF??) is central to the hypoxic response in animals. Prolyl hydroxylation of HIF?? increases its binding to the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), so signaling for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs, prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes) are related to the collagen prolyl hydroxylases, but form unusually stable complexes with their Fe(II) cofactor and 2-oxoglutarate cosubstrate. We report crystal structures of the catalytic domain of PHD2, the most important of the human PHDs, in complex with the C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1??. Together with biochemical analyses, the results reveal that PHD catalysis involves a mobile region that isolates the hydroxylation site and stabilizes the PHD2.Fe(II).2OG complex. The results will be of use in the design of PHD inhibitors aimed at treating anemia and ischemic disease. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are $\alpha$/$\beta$ heterodimeric transcription factors that direct multiple cellular and systemic responses in response to changes in oxygen availability. The oxygen sensitive signal is generated by a series of iron and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that catalyze post-translational hydroxylation of specific prolyl and asparaginyl residues in HIF$\alpha$ subunits and thereby promote their destruction and inactivation in the presence of oxygen. In hypoxia, these processes are suppressed allowing HIF to activate a massive transcriptional cascade. Elucidation of these pathways has opened several new fields of cardiovascular research. Here, we review the role of HIF hydroxylase pathways in cardiac development and in cardiovascular control. We also consider the current status, opportunities, and challenges of therapeutic modulation of HIF hydroxylases in the therapy of cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Negative cooperativity is a phenomenon in which the binding of one or more molecules of a ligand to a multimeric receptor makes it more difficult for subsequent ligand molecules to bind. Negative cooperativity can make a multimeric receptor's response more graded than it would otherwise be. However, through theory and experimental results, we show that if the ligand binds the receptor with high affinity and can be appreciably depleted by receptor binding, then negative cooperativity produces a qualitatively different type of response: a highly ultrasensitive response with a pronounced threshold. Because ultrasensitivity and thresholds are important for generating various complex systems-level behaviors, including bistability and oscillations, negative cooperativity may be an important ingredient in many types of biological responses.},

@article{Alipanahi2015,
abstract = {Knowing the sequence specificities of DNA-and RNA-binding proteins is essential for developing models of the regulatory processes in biological systems and for identifying causal disease variants. Here we show that sequence specificities can be ascertained from experimental data with 'deep learning' techniques, which offer a scalable, flexible and unified computational approach for pattern discovery. Using a diverse array of experimental data and evaluation metrics, we find that deep learning outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when training on in vitro data and testing on in vivo data. We call this approach DeepBind and have built a stand-alone software tool that is fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment. Specificities determined by DeepBind are readily visualized as a weighted ensemble of position weight matrices or as a 'mutation map' that indicates how variations affect binding within a specific sequence. DNA-and RNA-binding proteins play a central role in gene regula-tion, including transcription and alternative splicing. The sequence specificities of a protein are most commonly characterized using position weight matrices 1 (PWMs), which are easy to interpret and can be scanned over a genomic sequence to detect potential binding sites. However, growing evidence indicates that sequence specifici-ties can be more accurately captured by more complex techniques 2–5 . Recently, 'deep learning' has achieved record-breaking performance in a variety of information technology applications 6,7 . We adapted deep learning methods to the task of predicting sequence specificities and found that they compete favorably with the state of the art. Our approach, called DeepBind, is based on deep convolutional neural networks and can discover new patterns even when the locations of patterns within sequences are unknown—a task for which traditional neural networks require an exorbitant amount of training data. There are several challenging aspects in learning models of sequence specificity using modern high-throughput technologies. First, the data come in qualitatively different forms. Protein binding microarrays (PBMs) 8 and RNAcompete assays 9 provide a specificity coefficient for each probe sequence, whereas chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq 10 provides a ranked list of putatively bound sequences of varying length, and HT-SELEX 11 generates a set of very high affinity sequences. Second, the quantity of data is large. A typical high-throughput experiment measures between 10,000 and 100,000 sequences, and it is computationally demanding to incorporate them all. Third, each data acquisition technology has its own artifacts, biases and limitations, and we must discover the pertinent specificities despite these unwanted effects. For example, ChIP-seq reads often localize to " hyper-ChIPable " regions of the genome near highly expressed genes 12 . DeepBind (Fig. 1) addresses the above challenges. (i) It can be applied to both microarray and sequencing data; (ii) it can learn from millions of sequences through parallel implementation on a graphics processing unit (GPU); (iii) it generalizes well across technologies, even without correcting for technology-specific biases; (iv) it can tolerate a moderate degree of noise and mislabeled training data; and (v) it can train predictive models fully automatically, alleviating the need for careful and time-consuming hand-tuning. Importantly, a trained model can be applied and visualized in ways that are familiar to users of PWMs. We explored two downstream applications: uncovering the regulatory role of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in alternative splicing, and analyzing disease-associated genetic variants that can affect transcription factor binding and gene expression.},

abstract = {This is the first version of this article to be made available publicly. A peer-reviewed and modified version is now available in full at http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/9/R60 BACKGROUND:Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes is a necessary and critical step in the analysis of microarray data. The distributed nature of biological knowledge frequently requires researchers to navigate through numerous web-accessible databases gathering information one gene at a time. A more judicious approach is to provide query-based access to an integrated database that disseminates biologically rich information across large datasets and displays graphic summaries of functional information.RESULTS:Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID; http://www.david.niaid.nih.gov webcite) addresses this need via four web-based analysis modules: 1) Annotation Tool - rapidly appends descriptive data from several public databases to lists of genes; 2) GoCharts - assigns genes to Gene Ontology functional categories based on user selected classifications and term specificity level; 3) KeggCharts - assigns genes to KEGG metabolic processes and enables users to view genes in the context of biochemical pathway maps; and 4) DomainCharts - groups genes according to PFAM conserved protein domains.CONCLUSIONS:Analysis results and graphical displays remain dynamically linked to primary data and external data repositories, thereby furnishing in-depth as well as broad-based data coverage. The functionality provided by DAVID accelerates the analysis of genome-scale datasets by facilitating the transition from data collection to biological meaning.},

abstract = {Motif discovery has been one of the most widely studied problems in bioinformatics ever since genomic and protein sequences have been available. In particular, its application to the de novo prediction of putative over-represented transcription factor binding sites in nucleotide sequences has been, and still is, one of the most challenging flavors of the problem. Recently, novel experimental techniques like chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) have been introduced, permitting the genome-wide identification of protein-DNA interactions. ChIP, applied to transcription factors and coupled with genome tiling arrays (ChIP on Chip) or next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq) has opened new avenues in research, as well as posed new challenges to bioinformaticians developing algorithms and methods for motif discovery.},

abstract = {Dimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) is a critical epigenetic mark for gene repression and silencing and plays an essential role in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated the effects of hypoxic stress on H3K9me2 at both global and gene-specific level. We found that hypoxia increased global H3K9me2 in several mammalian cell lines. This hypoxia-induced H3K9me2 was temporally correlated with an increase in histone methyltransferase G9a protein and enzyme activity. The increase in H3K9me2 was significantly mitigated in G9a-/- mouse embryonic stem cells following hypoxia challenge, indicating that G9a was involved in the hypoxia-induced H3K9me2. In addition to the activation of G9a, our results also indicated that hypoxia increased H3K9me2 by inhibiting H3K9 demethylation processes. Hypoxic mimetics, such as deferoxamine and dimethyloxalylglycine, were also found to increase H3K9me2 as well as G9a protein and activity. Finally, hypoxia increased H3K9me2 in the promoter regions of the Mlh1 and Dhfr genes, and these increases temporally correlated with the repression of these genes. Collectively, these results indicate that G9a plays an important role in the hypoxia-induced H3K9me2, which would inhibit the expression of several genes that would likely lead to solid tumor progression.},

@article{Vockley2017,
abstract = {Genetic variation in gene regulatory elements contributes to diverse human diseases, ranging from rare and severe developmental defects to common and complex diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Early examples of regulatory mechanisms of human diseases involve large chromosomal rearrangements that change the regulatory connections within the genome. Single nucleotide variants in regulatory elements can also contribute to disease, potentially via demonstrated associations with changes in transcription factor binding, enhancer activity, post-translational histone modifications, long-range enhancer-promoter interactions, or RNA polymerase recruitment. Establishing causality between non-coding genetic variants, gene regulation, and disease has recently become more feasible with advances in genome-editing and epigenome-editing technologies. As establishing causal regulatory mechanisms of diseases becomes routine, functional annotation of target genes is likely to emerge as a major bottleneck for translation into patient benefits. In this review, we discuss the history and recent advances in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of human disease, and new challenges likely to be encountered once establishing those mechanisms becomes rote.},

To provide an unbiased view of human miRNA targets, we developed a technique for ligation and sequencing of miRNA-target RNA duplexes associated with human AGO1. Here, we report data sets of more than 18,000 high-confidence miRNA-mRNA interactions. The binding of most miRNAs includes the 5′ seed region, but around 60{\{}{\%}{\}} of seed interactions are noncanonical, containing bulged or mismatched nucleotides. Moreover, seed interactions are generally accompanied by specific, nonseed base pairing. 18{\{}{\%}{\}} of miRNA-mRNA interactions involve the miRNA 3′ end, with little evidence for 5′ contacts, and some of these were functionally validated. Analyses of miRNA:mRNA base pairing showed that miRNA species systematically differ in their target RNA interactions, and strongly overrepresented motifs were found in the interaction sites of several miRNAs. We speculate that these affect the response of RISC to miRNA-target binding.},

@article{Skuli2012,
abstract = {Localized tissue hypoxia is a consequence of vascular compromise or rapid cellular proliferation and is a potent inducer of compensatory angiogenesis. The oxygen-responsive transcriptional regulator hypoxia-inducible factor 2$\alpha$ (HIF-2$\alpha$) is highly expressed in vascular ECs and, along with HIF-1$\alpha$, activates expression of target genes whose products modulate vascular functions and angiogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which HIF-2$\alpha$ regulates EC function and tissue perfusion under physiological and pathological conditions are poorly understood. Using mice in which Hif2a was specifically deleted in ECs, we demonstrate here that HIF-2$\alpha$ expression is required for angiogenic responses during hindlimb ischemia and for the growth of autochthonous skin tumors. EC-specific Hif2a deletion resulted in increased vessel formation in both models; however, these vessels failed to undergo proper arteriogenesis, resulting in poor perfusion. Analysis of cultured HIF-2$\alpha$-deficient ECs revealed cell-autonomous increases in migration, invasion, and morphogenetic activity, which correlated with HIF-2$\alpha$-dependent expression of specific angiogenic factors, including delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), a Notch ligand, and angiopoietin 2. By stimulating Dll4 signaling in cultured ECs or restoring Dll4 expression in ischemic muscle tissue, we rescued most of the HIF-2$\alpha$-dependent EC phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, emphasizing the critical role of Dll4/Notch signaling as a downstream target of HIF-2$\alpha$ in ECs. These results indicate that HIF-1$\alpha$ and HIF-2$\alpha$ fulfill complementary, but largely nonoverlapping, essential functions in pathophysiological angiogenesis.},

@article{Bigham2009,
abstract = {High-altitude environments ({\textgreater}2,500 m) provide scientists with a natural laboratory to study the physiological and genetic effects of low ambient oxygen tension on human populations. One approach to understanding how life at high altitude has affected human metabolism is to survey genome-wide datasets for signatures of natural selection. In this work, we report on a study to identify selection-nominated candidate genes involved in adaptation to hypoxia in one highland group, Andeans from the South American Altiplano. We analysed dense microarray genotype data using four test statistics that detect departures from neutrality. Using a candidate gene, single nucleotide polymorphism-based approach, we identified genes exhibiting preliminary evidence of recent genetic adaptation in this population. These included genes that are part of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor ( HIF ) pathway, a biochemical pathway involved in oxygen homeostasis, as well as three other genomic regions previously not known to be associated with high-altitude phenotypes. In addition to identifying selection-nominated candidate genes, we also tested whether the HIF pathway shows evidence of natural selection. Our results indicate that the genes of this biochemical pathway as a group show no evidence of having evolved in response to hypoxia in Andeans. Results from particular HIF -targeted genes, however, suggest that genes in this pathway could play a role in Andean adaptation to high altitude, even if the pathway as a whole does not show higher relative rates of evolution. These data suggest a genetic role in high-altitude adaptation and provide a basis for genotype/phenotype association studies that are necessary to confirm the role of putative natural selection candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude.},

abstract = {The physicist Ernest Rutherford said, "If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment." Although this aphorism remains true for much of today's research in cell biology, a basic understanding of statistics can be useful to cell biologists to help in monitoring the conduct of their experiments, in interpreting the results, in presenting them in publications, and when critically evaluating research by others. However, training in statistics is often focused on the sophisticated needs of clinical researchers, psychologists, and epidemiologists, whose conclusions depend wholly on statistics, rather than the practical needs of cell biologists, whose experiments often provide evidence that is not statistical in nature. This review describes some of the basic statistical principles that may be of use to experimental biologists, but it does not cover the sophisticated statistics needed for papers that contain evidence of no other kind. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology Volume 30 is October 06, 2014.

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is a transcription factor that mediates many cellular responses to tissue hypoxia, a common feature of acute kidney injury (AKI). Here we studied 241 patients with AKI and determined the relationship to adverse outcome of a non-synonymous polymorphism in the coding region of the HIF-1alpha gene where a C to T substitution occurs at position +85 in exon 12, a change known to enhance transactivation. The baseline characteristics of the patients were not different among genotype groups except for a significantly higher prevalence of shock and number of failed organs in T-allele carriers. A significant genotype-phenotype association was found for plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A but not angiopoietin-2, two downstream targets of HIF-1alpha. Compared to the CC genotype, T-allele carriers had significantly higher adjusted odds for dialysis requirement or in-hospital death; assisted mechanical ventilation or dialysis requirement; and the composite of assisted mechanical ventilation, dialysis requirement or in-hospital death. The trend for higher plasma angiopoietin-2 levels was associated with significantly higher adjusted odds for in-hospital death; dialysis requirement or in-hospital death; and the composite outcome of assisted mechanical ventilation, dialysis, or in-hospital death. Despite the limited cohort size, our study found this particular HIF-1alpha genetic variant to be associated with disease severity and adverse outcomes in AKI. Larger studies are needed to confirm these relationships.},

We compared 85 patients with AMS to 79 Han unaffected with mountain sickness (MS) as well as 45 CMS patients to 34 unaffected Tibetan subjects. The three SNPs studied were EPAS1 [ch2: 46441523 (hg18], EGLN1 (rs480902) and (rs516651). Direct sequencing was used to identify individual genotypes for the three SNPs. Age was found to be significantly associated with the EPAS1 SNP in the CMS patients while heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation level of hemoglobin (SaO(2)) were found to be significantly associated with the EGLN1 (rs480902) SNP in the Han patients with AMS. The individuals with CMS were found to diverge significantly for the EPAS1 SNP compared to their Tibetan control group as measured by genetic distance (0.123) indicating positive selection of the EPAS-G allele with age and illness. The EGLN1 (rs480902) SNP had a significant correlation with hematocrit (HCT), HR and SaO(2) in AMS patients. AMS and CMS were found to be significantly associated with the EPAS1 and EGLN1 SNPs compared to their Han and Tibetan control groups, respectively, indicating these nucleotide alterations have a physiological effect for the development of high altitude sickness.},

abstract = {RATIONALE Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are afflicted by comorbidities. Few studies have prospectively evaluated COPD comorbidities and mortality risk. OBJECTIVES To prospectively evaluate COPD comorbidities and mortality risk. METHODS We followed 1,664 patients with COPD in five centers for a median of 51 months. Systematically, 79 comorbidities were recorded. We calculated mortality risk using Cox proportional hazard, and developed a graphic representation of the prevalence and strength of association to mortality in the form of a "comorbidome". A COPD comorbidity index (COPD specific comorbidity test [COTE]) was constructed based on the comorbidities that increase mortality risk using a multivariate analysis. We tested the COTE index as predictor of mortality and explored whether the COTE index added predictive information when used with the validated BODE index. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Fifteen of 79 comorbidities differed in prevalence between survivors and nonsurvivors. Of those, 12 predicted mortality and were integrated into the COTE index. Increases in the COTE index were associated with an increased risk of death from COPD-related (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} confidence interval, 1.08-1.18; P {\textless} 0.001) and non-COPD-related causes (HR, 1.18; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} confidence interval, 1.15-1.21; P {\textless} 0.001). Further, increases in the BODE and COTE were independently associated with increased risk of death. A COTE score of greater than or equal to 4 points increased by 2.2-fold the risk of death (HR, 2.26-2.68; P {\textless} 0.001) in all BODE quartile. CONCLUSIONS Comorbidities are frequent in COPD and 12 of them negatively influence survival. A simple disease-specific comorbidities index (COTE) helps assess mortality risk in patients with COPD.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TF) bind DNA sequence motifs, but the presence of a consensus DNA element is not sufficient to direct TF binding to chromatin. Recent genomic data have revealed that accessibility, as measured by DNase sensitivity and the presence of active histone marks, is necessary for TF binding. DNA sequence provides the initial specification of the accessibility of DNA elements within chromatin that permits TF binding. In yeast, it is known that poly(dA-dT) tracts directly encode low-nucleosome occupancy at promoters. Recent evidence suggests that CpG islands in mammals are inherently refractory to higher-order chromatin structure and remain accessible, despite favoring nucleosome formation in vitro. Taken together, these studies support a model for how accessibility originates and then propagates throughout regulatory cascades and development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Synergistic transcriptional activation by different stimuli has been reported along with a diverse array of mechanisms, but the full scope of these mechanisms has yet to be elucidated. RESULTS We present a detailed investigation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1 dependent gene expression in endothelial cells which suggests the importance of crosstalk between the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) $\beta$/$\delta$ and HIF signaling axes. A migration assay shows a synergistic interaction between these two stimuli, and we identify angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) as a common target gene by using a combination of microarray and ChIP-seq analysis. We profile changes of histone marks at enhancers under hypoxia, PPAR$\beta$/$\delta$ agonist and dual stimulations and these suggest that the spatial proximity of two response elements is the principal cause of the synergistic transcription induction. A newly developed quantitative chromosome conformation capture assay shows the quantitative change of the frequency of proximity of the two response elements. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that two different transcription factors cooperate in transcriptional regulation in a synergistic fashion through conformational change of their common target genes.},

abstract = {Summary Elevated postprandial blood glucose levels constitute a global epidemic and a major risk factor for prediabetes and type II diabetes, but existing dietary methods for controlling them have limited efficacy. Here, we continuously monitored week-long glucose levels in an 800-person cohort, measured responses to 46,898 meals, and found high variability in the response to identical meals, suggesting that universal dietary recommendations may have limited utility. We devised a machine-learning algorithm that integrates blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in this cohort and showed that it accurately predicts personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals. We validated these predictions in an independent 100-person cohort. Finally, a blinded randomized controlled dietary intervention based on this algorithm resulted in significantly lower postprandial responses and consistent alterations to gut microbiota configuration. Together, our results suggest that personalized diets may successfully modify elevated postprandial blood glucose and its metabolic consequences. Video Abstract},

abstract = {Decreased oxygen availability is a common feature during embryonic development as well of malignant tumours. Hypoxia regulates many transcription factors, and one of the most studied is the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). As a consequence of HIF stabilisation, the cell constitutively upregulates the hypoxic programme resulting in the expression of genes responsible for global changes in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, invasion, de-differentiation and energy metabolism. Of the three known alpha subunits of HIF transcription factors, HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha have been the most studied. Their differential expression and function have been widely discussed, however no clear picture has been drawn on how these two transcription factors differently regulate common and unique target genes. Their role as oncogenes has also been suggested in several studies. In this review we provide an overview of the current knowledge on some of the most important aspects of HIFalpha regulation, its role in tumour angiogenesis and energetic metabolism. We also give an overview of how the modulation of HIF regulating pathways is a potential therapeutic target that may have benefits in the treatment of cancer.},

We show that self-association of Nod1 mediates proximity of RICK and the interaction of RICK with the gamma subunit of the IkappaB kinase (IKKgamma). Similarly, the RICK-related kinase RIP associated via its intermediate region with IKKgamma. A mutant form of IKKgamma deficient in binding to IKKalpha and IKKbeta inhibited NF-kappaB activation induced by RICK or RIP. Enforced oligomerization of RICK or RIP as well as of IKKgamma, IKKalpha, or IKKbeta was sufficient for induction of NF-kappaB activation. Thus, the proximity of RICK, RIP, and IKK complexes may play an important role for NF-kappaB activation during Nod1 oligomerization or trimerization of the tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor.},

This toolbox facilitates affordable and rapid construction of custom TALE-TFs and TALENs within 1 week and can be easily scaled up to construct TALEs for multiple targets in parallel. We also provide details for testing the activity in mammalian cells of custom TALE-TFs and TALENs using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and Surveyor nuclease, respectively.

abstract = {Chronic hypoxia induces pulmonary vascular remodeling, leading to pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure. Heterozygous deficiency of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), which mediates the cellular response to hypoxia by increasing expression of genes involved in erythropoiesis and angiogenesis, has been previously shown to delay hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. HIF-2alpha is a homologue of HIF-1alpha and is abundantly expressed in the lung, but its role in pulmonary hypertension remains unknown. Therefore, we analyzed the pulmonary response of WT and viable heterozygous HIF-2alpha-deficient (Hif2alpha(+/-)) mice after exposure to 10{\{}{\%}{\}} O(2) for 4 weeks. In contrast to WT mice, Hif2alpha(+/-) mice were fully protected against pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy, unveiling a critical role of HIF-2alpha in hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling. Pulmonary expression levels of endothelin-1 and plasma catecholamine levels were increased threefold and 12-fold respectively in WT but not in Hif2alpha(+/-) mice after hypoxia, suggesting that HIF-2alpha-mediated upregulation of these vasoconstrictors contributes to the development of hypoxic pulmonary vascular remodeling.},

abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by progressive airfl ow obstruction that is only partly reversible, infl ammation in the airways, and systemic eff ects or comorbities. The main cause is smoking tobacco, but other factors have been identifi ed. Several pathobiological processes interact on a complex background of genetic determinants, lung growth, and environmental stimuli. The disease is further aggravated by exacerbations, particularly in patients with severe disease, up to 78{\%} of which are due to bacterial infections, viral infections, or both. Comorbidities include ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, and lung cancer. Bronchodilators constitute the mainstay of treatment: $\beta$ 2 agonists and long-acting anticholinergic agents are frequently used (the former often with inhaled corticosteroids). Besides improving symptoms, these treatments are also thought to lead to some degree of disease modifi cation. Future research should be directed towards the development of agents that notably aff ect the course of disease.},

abstract = {Gene expression is a multistep process that involves the transcription, translation and turnover of messenger RNAs and proteins. Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale. Here we simultaneously measured absolute mRNA and protein abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

Nucleotides (nt) 1 to 33 of this sequence mediate sevenfold induction of reporter gene expression when present in two tandem copies compared with threefold induction when present in a single copy, suggesting that nt 34 to 50 bind a factor which amplifies the induction signal. DNase I footprinting demonstrated binding of a constitutive nuclear factor to nt 26 to 48. Mutagenesis studies revealed that nt 4 to 12 and 19 to 23 are essential for induction, as substitutions at either site eliminated hypoxia-induced expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified a nuclear factor which bound to a probe spanning nt 1 to 18 but not to a probe containing a mutation which eliminated enhancer function. Factor binding was induced by hypoxia, and its induction was sensitive to cycloheximide treatment. We have thus defined a functionally tripartite, 50-nt hypoxia-inducible enhancer which binds several nuclear factors, one of which is induced by hypoxia via de novo protein synthesis.},

abstract = {Functional inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein is the cause of familial VHL disease and sporadic kidney cancer. The VHL gene product (pVHL) is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1 and 2 alpha subunits for polyubiquitylation. This process is dependent on the hydroxylation of conserved proline residues on the alpha subunits of HIF-1/2 in the presence of oxygen. In our effort to identify orphan HIF-like proteins in the data base that are potential targets of the pVHL complex, we report multiple splice variants of the human HIF-3 alpha locus as follows: hHIF-3 alpha 1, hHIF-3 alpha 2 (also referred to as hIPAS; human inhibitory PAS domain protein), hHIF-3 alpha 3, hHIF-3 alpha 4, hHIF-3 alpha 5, and hHIF-3 alpha 6. We demonstrate that the common oxygen-dependent degradation domain of hHIF-3 alpha 1-3 splice variants is targeted for ubiquitylation by the pVHL complex in vitro and in vivo. This activity is enhanced in the presence of prolyl hydroxylase and is dependent on a proline residue at position 490. Furthermore, the ubiquitin conjugation occurs on lysine residues at position 465 and 568 within the oxygen-dependent degradation domain. These results demonstrate additional targets of the pVHL complex and suggest a growing complexity in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible genes by the HIF family of transcription factors.},

abstract = {Hypoxia is an important component of many pathological processes including cancerogenesis and cirrhosis. We have attempted to identify additional hepatic genes sensitive to hypoxia by postulating that genes with possible binding sites for hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) are regulated by hypoxia. A computer analysis identified the oncodevelopmental alpha-fetoprotein gene (afp) as one of them. The amounts of both alpha-fetoprotein mRNA and protein were decreased under hypoxic conditions in HepG2 hepatoma cells. Stability of afp mRNA was not altered, and de novo synthesis of proteins was required. Transfection experiments in HepG2 cells showed that both hypoxia and overproduction of HIF-1alpha specifically repressed the transcriptional activity of the rat afp regulatory region through the sequence 5'-CACGTGGG-3' located at -3625 to -3619. Mutation in this sequence strongly impaired these repressions. Interestingly, this sequence was a functional stimulatory target for c-Myc, suggesting that c-Myc regulates afp gene expression. Lastly, the amounts of c-myc mRNA and protein were reduced when these cells were grown under hypoxic conditions. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of a possible competition between HIF-1 and c-Myc that could modulate the transcriptional activity of the afp gene in response to hypoxia.},

abstract = {Overexpression of the EGF receptor (EGFR) is a recurrent theme in human cancer and is thought to cause aggressive phenotypes and resistance to standard therapy. There has, thus, been a concerted effort in identifying EGFR gene mutations to explain misregulation of EGFR expression as well as differential sensitivity to anti-EGFR drugs. However, such genetic alterations have proven to be rare occurrences in most types of cancer, suggesting the existence of a more general physiological trigger for aberrant EGFR expression. Here, we provide evidence that overexpression of wild-type EGFR can be induced by the hypoxic microenvironment and activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF2alpha) in the core of solid tumors. Our data suggest that hypoxia/HIF2alpha activation represents a common mechanism for EGFR overexpression by increasing EGFR mRNA translation, thereby diminishing the necessity for gene mutations. This allows for the accumulation of elevated EGFR levels, increasing its availability for the autocrine signaling required for tumor cell growth autonomy. Taken together, our findings provide a nonmutational explanation for EGFR overexpression in human tumors and highlight a role for HIF2alpha activation in the regulation of EGFR protein synthesis.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that hypoxia would activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, leading to increased arginase expression and resulting in proliferation of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (hPMVEC). To test this hypothesis, hPMVEC were incubated in normoxia (20{\%} O(2), 5{\%} CO(2)) or hypoxia (1{\%} O(2), 5{\%} CO(2)). Immunoblotting for EGFR and proliferating cell nuclear antigen was done, and protein levels of both total EGFR and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were greater in hypoxic hPMVEC than in normoxic hPMVEC. Furthermore, hypoxic hPMVEC had greater levels of EGFR activity than did normoxic hPMVEC. Hypoxic hPMVEC had a twofold greater level of proliferation compared with normoxic controls, and this increase in proliferation was prevented by the addition of AG-1478 (a pharmacological inhibitor of EGFR). Immunoblotting for arginase I and arginase II demonstrated a threefold induction in arginase II protein levels in hypoxia, with little change in arginase I protein levels. The hypoxic induction of arginase II protein was prevented by treatment with AG-1478. Proliferation assays were performed in the presence of arginase inhibitors, and hypoxia-induced proliferation was also prevented by arginase inhibition. Finally, treatment with an EGFR small interfering RNA prevented hypoxia-induced proliferation and urea production. These findings demonstrate that hypoxia activates EGFR tyrosine kinase, leading to arginase expression and thereby promoting proliferation in hPMVEC.},

The role of the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in the pathogenesis of VHL-defective tumours has been more firmly established during the past 5 years. In addition, there is now a greater appreciation of HIF-independent VHL functions that are relevant to tumour development, including maintenance of the primary cilium, regulation of extracellular matrix formation and turnover, and modulation of cell death in certain cell types following growth factor withdrawal or in response to other forms of stress.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a DNA binding activity detected in nuclear extracts from Hep3B cells cultured in 1{\%} O2 but not in extracts from cells cultured in 20{\%} O2. HIF-1 binds to a sequence within the human erythropoietin gene enhancer that is required for hypoxic activation of transcription. Induction of HIF-1 is inhibited by cycloheximide, which also inhibits induction of erythropoietin RNA. We now demonstrate that induction of both HIF-1 and erythropoietin RNA is inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine. HIF-1 binding to DNA was eliminated by phosphatase treatment of nuclear extracts. Actinomycin D also inhibited HIF-1 induction, suggesting that de novo transcription is required. The kinetics of HIF-1 induction by hypoxia paralleled the kinetics of erythropoietin gene transcriptional induction. HIF-1 DNA binding activity decayed rapidly when hypoxic cells were exposed to increased oxygen tension. In vitro, the kinetics of HIF-1 association with, and dissociation from, its binding site were extremely rapid, with a t1/2 for both processes of {\textless} 1 min. These findings are consistent with the proposed function of HIF-1 as a physiologic regulator of gene expression that responds to changes in cellular oxygen tension. Methylation interference analysis indicated that HIF-1 makes specific contacts with DNA in the major groove.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) has a key role in cellular responses to hypoxia, including the regulation of genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis and apoptosis. The alpha subunits of HIF are rapidly degraded by the proteasome under normal conditions, but are stabilized by hypoxia. Cobaltous ions or iron chelators mimic hypoxia, indicating that the stimuli may interact through effects on a ferroprotein oxygen sensor. Here we demonstrate a critical role for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene product pVHL in HIF-1 regulation. In VHL-defective cells, HIF alpha-subunits are constitutively stabilized and HIF-1 is activated. Re-expression of pVHL restored oxygen-dependent instability. pVHL and HIF alpha-subunits co-immunoprecipitate, and pVHL is present in the hypoxic HIF-1 DNA-binding complex. In cells exposed to iron chelation or cobaltous ions, HIF-1 is dissociated from pVHL. These findings indicate that the interaction between HIF-1 and pVHL is iron dependent, and that it is necessary for the oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF alpha-subunits. Thus, constitutive HIF-1 activation may underlie the angiogenic phenotype of VHL-associated tumours. The pVHL/HIF-1 interaction provides a new focus for understanding cellular oxygen sensing.},

abstract = {Protein synthesis involves the translation of ribonucleic acid information into proteins, the building blocks of life. The initial step of protein synthesis is the binding of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) to the 7-methylguanosine (m(7)-GpppG) 5' cap of messenger RNAs. Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) represses cap-mediated translation by sequestering eIF4E through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent mechanisms. Although the internal ribosome entry site is an alternative translation initiation mechanism, this pathway alone cannot account for the translational capacity of hypoxic cells. This raises a fundamental question in biology as to how proteins are synthesized in periods of oxygen scarcity and eIF4E inhibition. Here we describe an oxygen-regulated translation initiation complex that mediates selective cap-dependent protein synthesis. We show that hypoxia stimulates the formation of a complex that includes the oxygen-regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 2$\alpha$ (HIF-2$\alpha$), the RNA-binding protein RBM4 and the cap-binding eIF4E2, an eIF4E homologue. Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) analysis identified an RNA hypoxia response element (rHRE) that recruits this complex to a wide array of mRNAs, including that encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor. Once assembled at the rHRE, the HIF-2$\alpha$-RBM4-eIF4E2 complex captures the 5' cap and targets mRNAs to polysomes for active translation, thereby evading hypoxia-induced repression of protein synthesis. These findings demonstrate that cells have evolved a program by which oxygen tension switches the basic translation initiation machinery.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Marked variability exists in coronary artery collaterals in patients with ischemic heart disease. Although multiple factors are thought to play a role in collateral development, the contribution of genetic factors is largely unknown. Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a transcriptional activator that functions as a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis, is one possible genetic factor that could play an important role in modulating collateral development. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Collateral vessels were determined in 100 patients with {\textgreater} or = 70{\{}{\%}{\}} narrowing of at least one coronary artery without acute myocardial infarction or prior revascularization. DNA was genotyped for the presence of a single nucleotide (C to T) polymorphism that changes residue 582 of HIF-1alpha from proline to serine. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The frequency of the T allele was significantly higher among patients without collaterals compared to patients with collaterals (0.188 vs 0.037, p {\textless} 0.001). In multivariate analyses, two variables affecting collateral formation were detected: two- or three-vessel coronary artery disease was a significant positive predictor (odds ratio [OR], 4.17; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} confidence interval [CI], 1.61 to 10.8; p = 0.001), whereas the presence of HIF-1alpha genotype CT or TT was a negative predictor (OR, 0.19; 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI, 0.04 to 0.84; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that variations in HIF-1alpha genotype may influence development of coronary artery collaterals in patients with significant coronary artery disease.},

abstract = {The transcription factor HIF1A is a key mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia. Despite the importance of HIF1A in homeostasis and various pathologies, little is known about how it regulates RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). We report here that HIF1A employs a specific variant of the Mediator complex to stimulate RNAPII elongation. The Mediator-associated kinase CDK8, but not the paralog CDK19, is required for induction of many HIF1A target genes. HIF1A induces binding of CDK8-Mediator and the super elongation complex (SEC), containing AFF4 and CDK9, to alleviate RNAPII pausing. CDK8 is dispensable for HIF1A chromatin binding and histone acetylation, but it is essential for binding of SEC and RNAPII elongation. Global analysis of active RNAPII reveals that hypoxia-inducible genes are paused and active prior to their induction. Our results provide a mechanistic link between HIF1A and CDK8, two potent oncogenes, in the cellular response to hypoxia.},

In our study, we investigated whether polymorphisms of the HIF-1alpha gene may account for the expression patterns of HIF-1alpha protein and impact of clinical progression in breast cancer. We also examined the impact of prognosis of HIF-1alpha gene polymorphism and protein expression in the prediction of biological behavior. We performed polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing to detect polymorphisms in exon 12 of HIF-1alpha from 90 breast cancer patients and 102 healthy controls. The expression of HIF-1alpha was measured in paraffin-embedded specimens from patients by immunohistochemistry. We associated its expression with known prognostic factors. The frequency of the T allele for C1772T in breast cancer patients and healthy controls was 5.6 vs. 4.4{\{}{\%}{\}}, whereas, the frequency of the A allele for G1790A was 1.7 vs. 4.4{\{}{\%}{\}}. HIF-1alpha was overexpressed in 56.7{\{}{\%}{\}} (51 of 90) of the patients. Its overexpression associated with the T1772 polymorphic allele (p=0.04).

These results suggest the potential use of C1772T (P582S) polymorphism and expression analysis in providing a new prognostic factor for unfavorable disease outcomes and may help for clinical decision-making in the treatment of breast cancer patients.},

abstract = {{\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2014 Neoplasia Press, Inc. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a member of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily, has potent anti-metastatic effects in cutaneous melanoma through its direct actions on endothelial and melanoma cells. Here we show that PEDF expression positively correlates with microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in melanoma cell lines and human samples. High PEDF and MITF expression is characteristic of low aggressive melanomas classified according to molecular and pathological criteria, whereas both factors are decreased in senescent melanocytes and naevi. Importantly, MITF silencing down-regulates PEDF expression in melanoma cell lines and primary melanocytes, suggesting that the correlation in the expression reflects a causal relationship. In agreement, analysis of Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) data sets revealed three MITF binding regions within the first intron of SERPINF1, and reporter assays demonstrated that the binding of MITF to these regions is sufficient to drive transcription. Finally, we demonstrate that exogenous PEDF expression efficiently halts in vitro migration and invasion, as well as in vivo dissemination of melanoma cells induced by MITF silencing. In summary, these results identify PEDF as a novel transcriptional target of MITF and support a relevant functional role for the MITF-PEDF axis in the biology of melanoma.},

abstract = {The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play a central role in oxygen homeostasis. Hydroxylation of one or two critical prolines by specific hydroxylases (P4Hs) targets their HIF-alpha subunits for proteasomal degradation. By studying the three human HIF-P4Hs, we found that the longest and shortest isoenzymes have major transcripts encoding inactive polypeptides, which suggest novel regulation by alternative splicing. Recombinant HIF-P4Hs expressed in insect cells required peptides of more than 8 residues, distinct differences being found between isoenzymes. All the HIF-P4Hs hydroxylated peptides corresponding to Pro564 in HIF-1alpha, whereas a Pro402 peptide had 20-50-fold Km values for two isoenzymes but was not hydroxylated by the shortest isoenzyme at all; this difference was not explained by the two prolines being in a -Pro402-Ala- and -Pro564-Tyr-sequence. All the HIF-P4Hs-hydroxylated peptides corresponding to two of three potential sites in HIF-2alpha and one in HIF-3alpha. The Km values for O2 were slightly above its atmospheric concentration, indicating that the HIF-P4Hs are effective oxygen sensors. Small molecule inhibitors of collagen P4Hs also inhibited the HIF-P4Hs, but with distinctly different Ki values, indicating that it should be possible to develop specific inhibitors for each class of P4Hs and possibly even for the individual HIF-P4Hs.},

abstract = {Mathematical equations are fundamental to modeling biological networks, but as networks get large and revisions frequent, it becomes difficult to manage equations directly or to combine previously developed models. Multiple simultaneous efforts to create graphical standards, rule-based languages, and integrated software workbenches aim to simplify biological modeling but none fully meets the need for transparent, extensible, and reusable models. In this paper we describe PySB, an approach in which models are not only created using programs, they are programs. PySB draws on programmatic modeling concepts from little b and ProMot, the rule-based languages BioNetGen and Kappa and the growing library of Python numerical tools. Central to PySB is a library of macros encoding familiar biochemical actions such as binding, catalysis, and polymerization, making it possible to use a high-level, action-oriented vocabulary to construct detailed models. As Python programs, PySB models leverage tools and practices from the open-source software community, substantially advancing our ability to distribute and manage the work of testing biochemical hypotheses. We illustrate these ideas using new and previously published models of apoptosis.},

In the presence of oxygen, HIF is targeted for destruction by an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). We found that human pVHL binds to a short HIF-derived peptide when a conserved proline residue at the core of this peptide is hydroxylated. Because proline hydroxylation requires molecular oxygen and Fe(2+), this protein modification may play a key role in mammalian oxygen sensing.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) regulates the major transcriptional cascade central to the response of all mammalian cells to alterations in oxygen tension. Expression arrays indicate that many hundreds of genes are regulated by this pathway, controlling diverse processes that in turn orchestrate both oxygen delivery and utilization. However, the extent to which HIF exerts direct versus indirect control over gene expression together with the factors dictating the range of HIF-regulated genes remains unclear. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to high throughput sequencing, we identify HIF-binding sites across the genome, independently of gene architecture. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we demonstrate robust associations with the regulation of gene expression by HIF, indicating that these sites operate over long genomic intervals. Analysis of HIF-binding motifs demonstrates sequence preferences outside of the core RCGTG-binding motif but does not reveal any additional absolute sequence requirements. Across the entire genome, only a small proportion of these potential binding sites are bound by HIF, although occupancy of potential sites was enhanced approximately 20-fold at normoxic DNAse1 hypersensitivity sites (irrespective of distance from promoters), suggesting that epigenetic regulation of chromatin may have an important role in defining the response to hypoxia.},

abstract = {The C-terminal activation domain (C-TAD) of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha binds the CH1 domains of the related transcriptional coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, an oxygen-regulated interaction thought to be highly essential for hypoxia-responsive transcription. The role of the CH1 domain in vivo is unknown, however. We created mutant mice bearing deletions in the CH1 domains (DeltaCH1) of CBP and p300 that abrogate their interactions with the C-TAD, revealing that the CH1 domains of CBP and p300 are genetically non-redundant and indispensable for C-TAD transactivation function. Surprisingly, the CH1 domain was only required for an average of approximately 35-50{\%} of global HIF-1-responsive gene expression, whereas another HIF transactivation mechanism that is sensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA(S)) accounts for approximately 70{\%}. Both pathways are required for greater than 90{\%} of the response for some target genes. Our findings suggest that a novel functional interaction between the protein acetylases CBP and p300, and deacetylases, is essential for nearly all HIF-responsive transcription.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by oxygen. In oxygenated and iron replete cells, HIF-alpha subunits are rapidly destroyed by a mechanism that involves ubiquitylation by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) E3 ligase complex. This process is suppressed by hypoxia and iron chelation, allowing transcriptional activation. Here we show that the interaction between human pVHL and a specific domain of the HIF-1alpha subunit is regulated through hydroxylation of a proline residue (HIF-1alpha P564) by an enzyme we have termed HIF-alpha prolyl-hydroxylase (HIF-PH). An absolute requirement for dioxygen as a cosubstrate and iron as cofactor suggests that HIF-PH functions directly as a cellular oxygen sensor.},

abstract = {SIN3 is a transcriptional repressor protein known to regulate many genes, including a number of those that encode mitochondrial components. By monitoring RNA levels, we find that loss of SIN3 in Drosophila cultured cells results in up-regulation of not only nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes, but also those encoded by the mitochondrial genome. The up-regulation of gene expression is accompanied by a perturbation in ATP levels in SIN3-deficient cells, suggesting that the changes in mitochondrial gene expression result in altered mitochondrial activity. In support of the hypothesis that SIN3 is necessary for normal mitochondrial function, yeast sin3 null mutants exhibit very poor growth on non-fermentable carbon sources and show lower levels of ATP and reduced respiration rates. The findings that both yeast and Drosophila SIN3 affect mitochondrial activity suggest an evolutionarily conserved role for SIN3 in the control of cellular energy production.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is an oxygen-sensitive dimeric transcription factor that responds to pathophysiologically low O2 tensions via up-regulation, which leads to an orchestrated biological response to hypoxia. The HIF prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes are non-heme, iron-containing dioxygenases requiring for activity both molecular oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate that, under normoxia, selectively hydroxylate proline residues of HIF, initiating proteosomal degradation of the latter. The dependence of HIF protein levels on the concentration of O2 present, mediated by the PHD enzymes, forms the basis for one of the most significant biological sensor systems of tissue oxygenation in response to ischemic and inflammatory events. Consequently, pharmacological inhibition of PHD enzymes, leading to stabilization of HIF, may be of considerable therapeutic potential in treating conditions of tissue stress and injury. This Perspective reviews the PHDs and small molecule drug discovery efforts. A critical view of this challenging field is offered, which addresses potential concerns and highlights exciting possibilities for the future.},

abstract = {Living at high altitude is demanding and thus drives adaptational mechanisms. The Tibetan population has had a longer evolutionary period to adapt to high altitude than other mountain populations such as Andeans. As a result, some Tibetans living at high altitudes do not show markedly elevated red blood cell production as compared to South American high altitude natives such as Quechuas or Aymaras, thereby avoiding high blood viscosity creating cardiovascular risk. Unexpectedly, the responsible mutation(s) reducing red blood cell production do not involve either the gene encoding the blood hormone erythropoietin (Epo), or the corresponding regulatory sequences flanking the Epo gene. Similarly, functional mutations in the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1{\$}\alpha{\$} (HIF-1{\$}\alpha{\$}) gene that represents the oxygen-dependent subunit of the HIF-1 heterodimer, the latter being the main regulator of over 100 hypoxia-inducible genes, have not been described so far. It was not until very recently that three independent groups showed that the gene encoding HIF-2{\$}\alpha{\$}, EPAS-1 (Wenger et al. 1997), represents a key gene mutated in Tibetan populations adapted to living at high altitudes (Beall et al. 2010 , Yi et al. 2010 , Simonson et al. 2010). Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors were first identified by the description of HIF-1 (Semenza et al. 1991 , 1992), which was subsequently found to enhance transcription of multiple genes that encode proteins necessary for rescuing from hypoxic exposure, including erythropoietic, angiogenic and glycolytic proteins. Then HIF-2 was identified (Ema et al. 1997 ; Flamme et al. 1997 ; Hogenesch et al. 1997 ; and Tian et al. 1997) and although it is highly similar to HIF-1 and has the potential to bind (Camenisch et al. 2001) and mediate (Mole et al. 2009) many of the same genes as HIF-1, its biological actions in response to hypoxia are distinct from those of HIF-1 (reviewed by Loboda et al. 2010). By now, several of these HIF-2 mediated processes have been implicated in the human response to high altitude exposure including erythropoiesis (Kapitsinou et al. 2010), iron homeostasis (Peyssonnaux et al. 2008), metabolism (Shohet et al. 2007; Tormos et al. 2010; Biswas et al. 2010 ; Rankin et al. 2009) and vascular permeability (Chen et al. 2009; Tanaka et al. 2005), among others. Clearly, mutation of EPAS-1 has the potential to bring far more advantage when adapting to high altitude than solely mutating the Epo gene.},

abstract = {Rho proteins are a branch of GTPases that belongs to the Ras superfamily which are critical elements of signal transduction pathways leading to a variety of cellular responses. This family of small GTPases has been involved in diverse biological functions such as cytoskeleton organization, cell growth and transformation, cell motility, migration, metastasis, and responses to stress. We report that several human Rho proteins including Rho A, Rho C and Rac 1, are capable of inducing apoptosis in different cell systems like murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts and the human erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Since K562 cells are devoid of p53, apoptosis induced by Rho in this system is independent of p53. Rho-dependent apoptosis is mediated by the generation of ceramides, and it is drastically inhibited by ectopic expression of Bcl2, both under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Furthermore, the human oncogenes vav and ost that have been shown to function as guanine exchange factors for Rho proteins, were also able to induce apoptosis under similar conditions. Finally, we also report that the levels of endogenous Rho proteins are increased when U937 myeloid leukemia cells are exposed to apoptosis-inducing conditions such as TNF alpha treatment. Furthermore, TNF alpha-induced apoptosis in these cells is inhibited by expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac 1 but it is not affected by a similar mutant of Rho A. These results suggest that Rho proteins play an important role in the physiological regulation of the apoptotic response to stress-inducing agents.},

abstract = {Targeting the hypoxia response pathway and angiogenesis are two promising therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. Their use as single strategies has important limitations. Thus, development of combined regimens has become an important step toward improving therapeutic efficacy. Also, non-invasive monitoring of the response to targeted biological therapies, as well as determination of the optimal schedule for combination regimens has become an active field of research over the last five years, with relevance for both preclinical and clinical settings. Here, we used an optical imaging method to non-invasively monitor the functional changes in HIF activity in response to antiangiogenic treatment in a xenograft model of human ovarian carcinoma. A bioluminescent reporter construct containing nine copies of the hypoxia response element upstream of the luciferase gene (9xHRE-luciferase) was characterized in vitro in a panel of tumor cell lines and in vivo in a subcutaneous xenograft model of ovarian carcinoma by means of optical imaging. We showed that in OVCAR-3 subcutaneous xenografts, the most abrupt change in the HIF functional reporter occurs before the onset of massive tumor growth. However, this system failed to detect hypoxia induced upon antiangiogenic treatment due to the compensating effects of increased hypoxia and decreased tumor cell viability caused by imbalanced neovascularization vs. tumor expansion. Therefore, the readout based on HIF functional reporter could be conditioned by the dynamics of tumor growth and angiogenesis, which is highly variable depending on the tumor type, tumor model and stage of progression.},

abstract = {The identification of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), fumarate hydratase (FH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations in human cancers has rekindled the idea that altered cellular metabolism can transform cells. Inactivating SDH and FH mutations cause the accumulation of succinate and fumarate, respectively, which can inhibit 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent enzymes, including the EGLN prolyl 4-hydroxylases that mark the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Inappropriate HIF activation is suspected of contributing to the pathogenesis of SDH-defective and FH-defective tumours but can suppress tumour growth in some other contexts. IDH1 and IDH2, which catalyse the interconversion of isocitrate and 2-OG, are frequently mutated in human brain tumours and leukaemias. The resulting mutants have the neomorphic ability to convert 2-OG to the (R)-enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate ((R)-2HG). Here we show that (R)-2HG, but not (S)-2HG, stimulates EGLN activity, leading to diminished HIF levels, which enhances the proliferation and soft agar growth of human astrocytes. These findings define an enantiomer-specific mechanism by which the (R)-2HG that accumulates in IDH mutant brain tumours promotes transformation and provide a justification for exploring EGLN inhibition as a potential treatment strategy.},

Binding differences were frequently associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic structural variants, and these differences were often correlated with differences in gene expression, suggesting functional consequences of binding variation. Furthermore, comparing PolII binding between humans and chimpanzee suggests extensive divergence in TF binding. Our results indicate that many differences in individuals and species occur at the level of TF binding, and they provide insight into the genetic events responsible for these differences.},

abstract = {Hypoxia is a fundamental stimulus that impacts cells, tissues, organs, and physiological systems. The discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and subsequent identification of other members of the HIF family of transcriptional activators has provided insight into the molecular underpinnings of oxygen homeostasis. This review focuses on the mechanisms of HIF activation and their roles in physiological and pathophysiological responses to hypoxia, with an emphasis on the cardiorespiratory systems. HIFs are heterodimers comprised of an O(2)-regulated HIF-1$\alpha$ or HIF-2$\alpha$ subunit and a constitutively expressed HIF-1$\beta$ subunit. Induction of HIF activity under conditions of reduced O(2) availability requires stabilization of HIF-1$\alpha$ and HIF-2$\alpha$ due to reduced prolyl hydroxylation, dimerization with HIF-1$\beta$, and interaction with coactivators due to decreased asparaginyl hydroxylation. Stimuli other than hypoxia, such as nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, can also activate HIFs. HIF-1 and HIF-2 are essential for acute O(2) sensing by the carotid body, and their coordinated transcriptional activation is critical for physiological adaptations to chronic hypoxia including erythropoiesis, vascularization, metabolic reprogramming, and ventilatory acclimatization. In contrast, intermittent hypoxia, which occurs in association with sleep-disordered breathing, results in an imbalance between HIF-1$\alpha$ and HIF-2$\alpha$ that causes oxidative stress, leading to cardiorespiratory pathology.},

@article{Tejero2017a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the American Thoracic Society. Rationale: Global Lung Function Initiative recommends reporting lung function measures as z-score, and a classification of airflow limitation (AL) based on this parameter has recently been proposed. Objectives: To evaluate the prognostic capacity of the AL classifications based on z-score or percentage predicted of FEV 1  in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: A cohort of 2,614 patients with COPD recruited outside the hospital setting was examined after a mean (±SD) of 57±13 months of follow-up, totaling 10,322 person-years. All-cause mortality was analyzed, evaluating the predictive capacity of several AL staging systems. Measurements and Main Results: Based on Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines, 461 patients (17.6{\%}) hadmild, 1,452 (55.5{\%}) moderate, 590 (22.6{\%}) severe, and 111 (4.2{\%}) very severe AL. According to z-score classification, 66.3{\%} of patients remained with the same severity, whereas 23.7{\%} worsened and 10.0{\%} improved. Unlike other staging systems, patients with severe AL according to z-score had higher mortality than those with very severe AL (increase of risk by 5.2 and 3.9 times compared with mild AL, respectively). The predictive capacity for 5-year survival was slightly higher for FEV 1  expressed as percentage of predicted than as z-score (area under the curve: 0.714-0.760 vs. 0.649-0.708, respectively). A severity-dependent relationship between AL grades by z-score and mortality was only detected in patients younger than age 60 years. Conclusions: In patients with COPD, the AL classification based on z-score predicts worse mortality than those based on percentage of predicted. It is possible that the z-score underestimates AL severity in patients older than 60 years of age with severe functional impairment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The multisubunit SIN3 complex is a global transcriptional regulator. In Drosophila, a single Sin3A gene encodes different isoforms of SIN3, of which SIN3 187 and SIN3 220 are the major isoforms. Previous studies have demonstrated functional non-redundancy of SIN3 isoforms. The role of SIN3 isoforms in regulating distinct biological processes, however, is not well characterized.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We established a Drosophila S2 cell culture model system in which cells predominantly express either SIN3 187 or SIN3 220. To identify genomic targets of SIN3 isoforms, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing. Our data demonstrate that upon overexpression of SIN3 187, the level of SIN3 220 decreased and the large majority of genomic sites bound by SIN3 220 were instead bound by SIN3 187. We used RNA-seq to identify genes regulated by the expression of one isoform or the other. In S2 cells, which predominantly express SIN3 220, we found that SIN3 220 directly regulates genes involved in metabolism and cell proliferation. We also determined that SIN3 187 regulates a unique set of genes and likely modulates expression of many genes also regulated by SIN3 220. Interestingly, biological pathways enriched for genes specifically regulated by SIN3 187 strongly suggest that this isoform plays an important role during the transition from the embryonic to the larval stage of development.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These data establish the role of SIN3 isoforms in regulating distinct biological processes. This study substantially contributes to our understanding of the complexity of gene regulation by SIN3.},

abstract = {Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is currently one of the most treatment-resistant malignancies. However, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying RCC development has led to the identification of promising targets for novel therapeutic agents. The involvement of the Von Hippel-Lindau protein pathway in clear cell RCC suggests that downstream targets of this pathway, namely, signaling through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in endothelial cells, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in endothelial cells and pericytes, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway in tumor cells are all reasonable and rational therapeutic targets. A number of agents are in development that target VEGF (bevacizumab, a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody) or its receptor, VEGFR (PTK787, SU011248, and BAY 43-9006, all of which are small molecule inhibitors). Agents targeting EGFR also are being investigated clinically (gefitinib, cetuximab, erlotinib, and ABX-EGF). The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is an important downstream convergence point for signaling through VEGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and EGFR (all have receptor tyrosine kinase activity) and also has important antiapoptotic effects, thereby providing an attractive target for intervention. In addition to inhibiting VEGFR and PDGFR-mediated angiogenic pathways, BAY 43-9006 has been shown to inhibit the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at the level of Raf kinase. MEK-directed therapeutic approaches are also in development. Given that multiple molecular pathways are implicated in tumor cell growth, antitumor activity may be increased by using individual agents that target multiple pathways, or by combining different agents to allow vertical or horizontal inhibition of relevant pathways.},

abstract = {A central regulator of cell growth that has been implicated in responses to stress such as hypoxia is mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin). We have shown previously that mTOR is required for angiogenesis in vitro and endothelial cell proliferation in response to hypoxia. Here we have investigated mTOR-associated signaling components under hypoxia and their effects on cell proliferation in rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs). Hypoxia (1{\{}{\%}{\}} O(2)) rapidly ({\textgreater}30 minutes) and in a concentration-dependent manner promoted rapamycin-sensitive and sustained phosphorylation of mTOR-Ser2448 followed by nuclear translocation in RAECs. Similarly, hypoxia induced phosphorylation of the mTORC2 substrate Akt-Ser473 (3 to 6 hours at 1{\{}{\%}{\}} O(2)) and a brief phosphorylation peak of the mTORC1 substrate S6 kinase-Thr389 (10 to 60 minutes). Phosphorylation of Akt was inhibited by mTOR knockdown and partially with rapamycin. mTOR knockdown, rapamycin, or Akt inhibition specifically and significantly inhibited proliferation of serum-starved RAECs under hypoxia (P{\textless}0.05; n{\textgreater} or =4). Similarly, hypoxia induced Akt-dependent and rapamycin-sensitive proliferation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. This response was partially blunted by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha knockdown and not affected by TSC2 knockout. Finally, mTORC2 inhibition by rictor silencing, especially (P{\textless}0.001; n=7), and mTORC1 inhibition by raptor silencing, partially (P{\textless}0.05; n=7), inhibited hypoxia-induced RAEC proliferation. Thus, mTOR mediates an early response to hypoxia via mTORC1 followed by mTORC2, promoting endothelial proliferation mainly via Akt signaling. mTORC1 and especially mTORC2 might therefore play important roles in diseases associated with hypoxia and altered angiogenesis.},

abstract = {Akt, a proto-oncogene that encodes a cytosolic serine/threonine kinase, can phosphorylate and modulate the activity of several proteins involved in cellular metabolism and survival. Recently, two mammalian highly related forkhead transcription factors FKHRL1 and AFX and their nematode homologue Daf-16 have been found to be targets of this kinase. Here we show that Akt, but not inactive Akt, represses the transcriptional activity of FKHR, another member of the forkhead family. FKHR mutants with alanine substitutions at three Akt phosphorylation consensus sites (T24, S256 and S319) were inhibited by Akt, but mutation of all three sites rendered FKHR resistant to suppression. By contrast, the transcriptional activity of the oncogenic PAX3-FKHR fusion protein, containing two consensus phosphorylation sites, was not inhibited by Akt. Importantly, Akt inhibited the translocation of FKHR to the nucleus, providing a mechanism by which Akt might regulate the transcriptional activity of FKHR. Consistent with this model, the localization of the PAX3-FKHR fusion protein was nuclear and was not altered by Akt. These results provide evidence that Akt inhibits the transcriptional activity of FKHR by controlling its trafficking into the nucleus and that oncogenic PAX3-FKHR can escape this negative regulation by Akt.},

This review considers how TFs are identified and functionally characterized, principally through the lens of a catalog of over 1,600 likely human TFs and binding motifs for two-thirds of them. Major classes of human TFs differ markedly in their evolutionary trajectories and expression patterns, underscoring distinct functions.

SINHCAF Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-sequencing and gene expression analysis reveal a signature associated with the activation of the hypoxia response. We show that SINHCAF specifically repress HIF 2$\alpha$ mRNA and protein expression resulting in functional cellular changes in in-vitro angiogenesis, and proliferation. Analysis of patient datasets demonstrates that SINHCAF and HIF 2$\alpha$ mRNA levels are inversely correlated and predict contrasting outcomes for patient survival in both colon and lung cancer. This relationship is also observed in a mouse model of colon cancer, indicating an evolutionary conserved mechanism.

abstract = {The zinc-dependent mammalian histone deacetylase (HDAC) family comprises 11 enzymes, which have specific and critical functions in development and tissue homeostasis. Mounting evidence points to a link between misregulated HDAC activity and many oncologic and nononcologic diseases. Thus the development of HDAC inhibitors for therapeutic treatment garners a lot of interest from academic researchers and biotechnology entrepreneurs. Numerous studies of HDAC inhibitor specificities and molecular mechanisms of action are ongoing. In one of these studies, mass spectrometry was used to characterize the affinities and selectivities of HDAC inhibitors toward native HDAC multiprotein complexes in cell extracts. Such a novel approach reproduces in vivo molecular interactions more accurately than standard studies using purified proteins or protein domains as targets and could be very useful in the isolation of inhibitors with superior clinical efficacy and decreased toxicity compared to the ones presently tested or approved. HDAC inhibitor induced-transcriptional reprogramming, believed to contribute largely to their therapeutic benefits, is achieved through various and complex mechanisms not fully understood, including histone deacetylation, transcription factor or regulator (including HDAC1) deacetylation followed by chromatin remodeling and positive or negative outcome regarding transcription initiation. Although only a very low percentage of protein-coding genes are affected by the action of HDAC inhibitors, about 40{\%} of noncoding microRNAs are upregulated or downregulated. Moreover, a whole new world of long noncoding RNAs is emerging, revealing a new class of potential targets for HDAC inhibition. HDAC inhibitors might also regulate transcription elongation and have been shown to impinge on alternative splicing.},

abstract = {Diarrhea is widespread in intestinal diseases involving ischemia and/or hypoxia. Since hypoxia alters stimulated Cl(-) and water flux, we investigated the influence of such a physiologically and pathophysiologically important signal on expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Located on the apical membrane, this cAMP-activated Cl(-) channel determines salt and fluid transport across mucosal surfaces. Our studies revealed depression of CFTR mRNA, protein, and function in hypoxic epithelia. Chromatin immunoprecipitation identified a previously unappreciated binding site for the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), and promoter studies established its relevance by loss of repression following point mutation. Consequently, HIF-1 overexpressing cells exhibited significantly reduced transport capacity in colorimetric Cl(-) efflux studies, altered short circuit measurements, and changes in transepithelial fluid movement. Whole-body hypoxia in wild-type mice resulted in significantly reduced small intestinal fluid and HCO(3)(-) secretory responses to forskolin. Experiments performed in Cftr(-/-) and Nkcc1(-/-) mice underlined the role of altered CFTR expression for these functional changes, and work in conditional Hif1a mutant mice verified HIF-1-dependent CFTR regulation in vivo. In summary, our study clarifies CFTR regulation and introduces the concept of a HIF-1-orchestrated response designed to regulate ion and fluid movement across hypoxic intestinal epithelia.},

abstract = {The tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is mutated in the majority of colorectal cancers and is best known for its role as a scaffold in a Wnt-regulated protein complex that determines the availability of $\beta$-catenin. Another common feature of solid tumors is the presence of hypoxia as indicated by the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) such as HIF-1$\alpha$. Here, we demonstrate a novel link between APC and hypoxia and show that APC and HIF-1$\alpha$ antagonize each other. Hypoxia results in reduced levels of APC mRNA and protein via a HIF-1$\alpha$-dependent mechanism. HIF-1$\alpha$ represses the APC gene via a functional hypoxia-responsive element on the APC promoter. In contrast, APC-mediated repression of HIF-1$\alpha$ requires wild-type APC, low levels of $\beta$-catenin, and nuclear factor-$\kappa$B activity. These results reveal down-regulation of APC as a new mechanism that contributes to the survival advantage induced by hypoxia and also show that loss of APC mutations produces a survival advantage by mimicking hypoxic conditions.},

abstract = {Extracellular adenosine has been implicated in vascular adaptation to hypoxia. Based on the observation that increases in intracellular adenosine can effectively elevate extracellular adenosine, we studied the contribution of adenosine kinase (AK, intracellular conversion of adenosine to adenosine monophosphate [AMP]) to vascular adenosine responses. Initial in vitro studies of ambient hypoxia revealed prominent repression of endothelial AK transcript (85{\%} +/- 2{\%} reduction), protein, and function. Transcription factor binding assays and hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha) loss- and gain-of-function studies suggested a role for HIF-1alpha in transcriptional repression of AK. Moreover, repression of AK by ambient hypoxia was abolished in conditional HIF-1alpha mutant mice in vivo. Studies of endothelial barrier function revealed that inhibition or siRNA repression of AK is associated with enhanced adenosine-dependent barrier responses in vitro. Moreover, in vivo studies of vascular barrier function demonstrated that AK inhibition with 5'-iodotubericidin (1 mg/kg prior to hypoxia) significantly attenuated hypoxia-induced vascular leakage in multiple organs and reduced hypoxia-associated increases in lung water. Taken together, our data reveal a critical role of AK in modulating vascular adenosine responses and suggest pharmacologic inhibitors of AK in the treatment of conditions associated with hypoxia-induced vascular leakage (eg, sepsis or acute lung injury).},

abstract = {Satellite cells are muscle-resident stem cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation to repair injured muscles. However, muscle injury often leads to an ischemic hypoxia environment that impedes satellite cell differentiation and reduces the efficiency of muscle regeneration. Here we performed microarray analyses and identified the basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor Bhlhe40 as a candidate mediator of the myogenic inhibitory effect of hypoxia. Bhlhe40 is strongly induced by hypoxia in satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts. Overexpression of Bhlhe40 inhibits Myog expression and mimics the effect of hypoxia on myogenesis. Inhibition of Bhlhe40, conversely, up-regulates Myog expression and promotes myogenic differentiation. Importantly, Bhlhe40 knockdown rescues myogenic differentiation under hypoxia. Mechanistically, Bhlhe40 binds to the proximal E-boxes of the Myog promoter and reduces the binding affinity and transcriptional activity of MyoD on Myog. Interestingly, hypoxia induces Bhlhe40 expression independent of HIF1alpha but through a novel p53-dependent signaling pathway. Our study establishes a crucial role of Bhlhe40 in mediating the repressive effect of hypoxia on myogenic differentiation and suggests that inhibition of Bhlhe40 or p53 may facilitate muscle regeneration after ischemic injuries.},

abstract = {Hypoxia induces a variety of cellular responses such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy. Most of these responses are mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha. To induce target genes, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha requires a chromatin environment conducive to allow binding to specific sequences. Here, we have studied the role of the chromatin-remodeling complex SWI/SNF in the cellular response to hypoxia. We find that SWI/SNF is required for several of the cellular responses induced by hypoxia. Surprisingly, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha is a direct target of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. SWI/SNF components are found associated with the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha promoter and modulation of SWI/SNF levels results in pronounced changes in hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression and its ability to transactivate target genes. Furthermore, impairment of SWI/SNF function renders cells resistant to hypoxia-induced cell cycle arrest. These results reveal a previously uncharacterized dependence of hypoxia signaling on the SWI/SNF complex and demonstrate a new level of control over the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha system.},

abstract = {Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) regulates normal melanocyte development and is also a lineage-selective oncogene implicated in melanoma and clear-cell sarcoma (i.e., melanoma of soft parts). We have observed that MITF expression is potently reduced under hypoxic conditions in primary melanocytes and melanoma and clear cell sarcoma cells through hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1)-mediated induction of the transcriptional repressor differentially expressed in chondrocytes protein 1 (DEC1) (BHLHE40), which subsequently binds and suppresses the promoter of M-MITF (melanocyte-restricted MITF isoform). Correspondingly, hypoxic conditions or HIF1alpha stabilization achieved by using small-molecule prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors reduced M-MITF expression, leading to melanoma cell growth arrest that was rescued by ectopic expression of M-MITF in vitro. Prolyl hydroxylase inhibition also potently suppressed melanoma growth in a mouse xenograft model. These studies illuminate a physiologic hypoxia response in pigment cells leading to M-MITF suppression, one that suggests a potential survival advantage mechanism for MITF amplification in metastatic melanoma and offers a small-molecule strategy for suppression of the MITF oncogene in vivo.},

abstract = {The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a master regulator of the cellular response to hypoxia. Its levels and activity are controlled by dioxygenases called prolyl-hydroxylases and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). To activate genes, HIF has to access sequences in DNA that are integrated in chromatin. It is known that the chromatin-remodeling complex switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) is essential for HIF activity. However, no additional information exists about the role of other chromatin-remodeling enzymes in hypoxia. Here we describe the role of imitation switch (ISWI) in the cellular response to hypoxia. We find that unlike SWI/SNF, ISWI depletion enhances HIF activity without altering its levels. Furthermore, ISWI knockdown only alters a subset of HIF target genes. Mechanistically, we find that ISWI is required for full expression of FIH mRNA and protein levels by changing RNA polymerase II loading to the FIH promoter. Of interest, exogenous FIH can rescue the ISWI-mediated upregulation of CA9 but not BNIP3, suggesting that FIH-independent mechanisms are also involved. Of importance, ISWI depletion alters the cellular response to hypoxia by reducing autophagy and increasing apoptosis. These results demonstrate a novel role for ISWI as a survival factor during the cellular response to hypoxia.},

abstract = {Upon hypoxia, the human erythropoietin (EPO) gene is transactivated by the heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Mammalian SWI/SNF is a chromatin-remodeling complex involved in the modulation of gene expression. We demonstrate that Brahma (Brm) and Brahma/SWI2-related gene 1 (Brg-1), alternative ATPase subunits of SWI/SNF, potentiate reporter gene activation mediated by HIF-1 in an ATPase-dependent manner. Brm was more potent than Brg-1 in the reporter gene assays. Simultaneous depletion of both Brm and Brg-1 by small interfering RNAs significantly compromised the transcription of the endogenous EPO gene triggered by hypoxia. Whereas knocking down Brm alone resulted in a moderate reduction in transcription of the EPO gene, depletion of Brg-1 resulted in an augmentation of transcription of both the EPO gene and the Brm gene, indicating that Brm can compensate for loss of Brg-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequential ChIP (re-ChIP) analysis showed that both Brm and Brg-1 associate with the enhancer region of the EPO gene in vivo in a hypoxia-dependent fashion and that each is present in a complex with HIF-1. Brm and Brg-1 were also recruited to the promoter of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene in a hypoxia-dependent fashion, although hypoxic induction of VEGF transcription was not affected by depletions of either or both Brm and Brg-1. Together these studies reveal a novel role for SWI/SNF in the activation of transcription of the EPO gene, indicate an important communication and compensation between Brm and Brg-1, and suggest that the requirement for SWI/SNF during hypoxic induction is gene-specific.},

abstract = {Changes in the availability or demand for oxygen induce dramatic changes at the cellular level. Primarily, activation of a family of oxygen labile transcription factors, Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF), initiates a variety of cellular processes required to re-instate oxygen homeostasis. Oxygen is sensed by molecular dioxygenases in cells, such as the prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs), enzymes which are responsible for the oxygen-dependent regulation of HIF. As HIF is a transcription factor it must bind DNA sequences of its target genes possibly in the context of a complex chromatin structure. How chromatin structure changes in response to hypoxia is currently unknown. However, the identification of a novel class of histone demethylases as true dioxygenases suggests that chromatin can act as an oxygen sensor and plays an active role in the coordination of the cellular response to hypoxia. This review will discuss the current knowledge on how hypoxia engages with different proteins involved in chromatin organisation and dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Molecular mechanisms that mediate oxygen-dependent HIF regulation operate at the level of the alpha subunit, controlling protein stability, subcellular localization, and transcriptional coactivator recruitment. We have conducted an unbiased genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila cells aimed to the identification of genes required for HIF activity. After 3 rounds of selection, 30 genes emerged as critical HIF regulators in hypoxia, most of which had not been previously associated with HIF biology. The list of genes includes components of chromatin remodeling complexes, transcription elongation factors, and translational regulators. One remarkable hit was the argonaute 1 (ago1) gene, a central element of the microRNA (miRNA) translational silencing machinery. Further studies confirmed the physiological role of the miRNA machinery in HIF-dependent transcription. This study reveals the occurrence of novel mechanisms of HIF regulation, which might contribute to developing novel strategies for therapeutic intervention of HIF-related pathologies, including heart attack, cancer, and stroke.},

abstract = {G9a is an epigenetic regulator that methylates H3K9, generally causing repression of gene expression, and participates in diverse cellular functions. G9a is genetically deregulated in a variety of tumor types and can silence tumor suppressor genes and, therefore, is important for carcinogenesis. Although hypoxia is recognized to be an adverse factor in tumor growth and metastasis, the role of G9a in regulating gene expression in hypoxia has not been described extensively. Here, we show that G9a protein stability is increased in hypoxia via reduced proline hydroxylation and, hence, inefficient degradation by the proteasome. This inefficiency leads to an increase in H3K9me2 at its target promoters. Blocking the methyltransferase activity of G9a inhibited cellular proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, an increased level of G9a is a crucial factor in mediating the hypoxic response by down-regulating the expression of specific genes, including ARNTL, CEACAM7, GATA2, HHEX, KLRG1, and OGN This down-regulation can be rescued by a small molecule inhibitor of G9a. Based on the hypothesis that the changes in gene expression would influence patient outcomes, we have developed a prognostic G9a-suppressed gene signature that can stratify breast cancer patients. Together, our findings provide an insight into the role G9a plays as an epigenetic mediator of hypoxic response, which can be used as a diagnostic marker, and proposes G9a as a therapeutic target for solid cancers.},

abstract = {The transcription factor HIF-1$\alpha$ activity is increased in adipose tissue to contribute to chronic inflammation in obesity. However, its upstream and downstream events remain to be characterized in adipose tissue in obesity. We addressed this issue by investigating adipocyte HIF-1$\alpha$ activity in response to obesity-associated factors, such as adipogenesis, insulin, and hypoxia. In adipose tissue, both HIF-1$\alpha$ mRNA and protein were increased by obesity. The underlying mechanism was investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. HIF-1$\alpha$ mRNA and protein were augmented by adipocyte differentiation. In differentiated adipocytes, insulin further enhanced HIF-1$\alpha$ in both levels. Hypoxia enhanced only HIF-1$\alpha$ protein, not mRNA. PI3K and mTOR activities are required for the HIF-1$\alpha$ expression. Function of HIF-1$\alpha$ protein was investigated in the regulation of VEGF gene transcription. ChIP assay shows that HIF-1$\alpha$ binds to the proximal hypoxia response element in the VEGF gene promoter, and its function is inhibited by a corepressor composed of HDAC3 and SMRT. These observations suggest that of the three obesity-associated factors, all of them are able to augment HIF-1$\alpha$ protein levels, but only two (adipogenesis and insulin) are able to enhance HIF-1$\alpha$ mRNA activity. Adipose tissue HIF-1$\alpha$ activity is influenced by multiple signals, including adipogenesis, insulin, and hypoxia in obesity. The transcriptional activity of HIF-1$\alpha$ is inhibited by HDAC3-SMRT corepressor in the VEGF gene promoter.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) emerges as a crucial player in tumor progression. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially its relation with global DNA methylation patterns in HCC under hypoxic tumor microenvironment is not completely understood. Methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) maintains the homeostasis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a critical marker of genomic methylation status. In this study, we investigated the link between HIF-1$\alpha$ and MAT2A as a mechanism responsible for the change in genomic DNA methylation patterns in liver cancer under hypoxia conditions. Our results showed that hypoxia induces genomic DNA demethylation in CpG islands by reducing the steady-state SAM level both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, HIF-1$\alpha$ and MAT2A expression is correlated with tumor size and TNM stage of liver cancer tissues. We further showed that hypoxia-induced MAT2A expression is HIF-1$\alpha$ dependent and requires the recruitment of p300 and HDAC1. We also identified an authentic consensus HIF-1$\alpha$ binding site in MAT2A promoter by site-directed mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Taken together, we show for the first time that hypoxia induces genomic DNA demethylation through the activation of HIF-1$\alpha$ and transcriptional upregulation of MAT2A in hepatoma cells. These findings provide new insights into our understanding of the molecular link between genomic DNA methylation and tumor hypoxia in HCC.},

abstract = {Hypoxia plays a key role in the pathophysiology of many disease states, and expression of the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORalpha) gene increases under hypoxia. We investigated the mechanism for this transient hypoxia-induced increase in RORalpha expression. Reverse transcription-coupled PCR analysis revealed that the steady-state level of mRNA for the RORalpha4 isoform, but not the RORalpha1 isoform, increased in HepG2 cells after 3 h of hypoxia. Transient transfection studies showed that the hypoxia-induced increase in RORalpha4 mRNA occurs at the transcriptional level and is dependent on a hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) located downstream of the promoter. A dominant-negative mutant of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) abrogates the transcription activated by hypoxia as well as the transcription activated by exogenously expressed HIF-1alpha, demonstrating the direct involvement of HIF-1alpha in the transcriptional activation. However, HIF-1 alone was not sufficient to activate transcription in hypoxic conditions but, rather, required Sp1/Sp3, which binds to a cluster of GC-rich sequences adjacent to the HRE. Deletion of one or more of these GC boxes reduced or eliminated the HIF-1-dependent transcription. Together, these results suggest that the hypoxia-responsive region of the RORalpha4 promoter is composed of the HRE and GC-rich sequences and that the transcriptional activation under hypoxia is conferred through the cooperation of HIF-1 with Sp1/Sp3.},

abstract = {Erythropoietin (Epo) is the humoral regulator of red blood-cell production. Low oxygen tension increases the Epo levels by enhancing transcription, through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, a transcriptional modulator in oxygen-regulated gene expression. In the present work, a cooperative interaction between hypoxia, mediated by the HIF-1 complex, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), mediated by Smad3/4, was revealed in the Epo gene. This cooperation is due to physical interaction between Smad3/4 and HIF-1alpha. The Smad3/4 binding site is located within the 3' Epo enhancer, downstream from the HRE consensus, and immediately adjacent to the orphan hepatic nuclear factor receptor (HNF-4). HNF-4 is interacting also with Smad3 and the HIF-1 complex, to potentiate further the cooperative effect between both factors. Moreover, Sp1 has been identified as the factor binding the promoter necessary for the full hypoxia inducibility of the EPO gene. However, this full induction is achieved only if the TGF-beta pathway is mediating a cross-talk between promoter (Sp1) and enhancer (HIF-1alpha) regions through Smad3. We show that Sp1 binding to the proximal promoter is relevant for Epo transcription, and contributes to the Epo induction by hypoxia. A functional cooperation among the transcription factors mediating hypoxia (HIF-1, Sp1), the TGF-beta pathway (Smad3/4), and tissue-specific HNF-4 is proposed for the regulation of the Epo gene. In this model, the physical contact between the upstream promoter and the 3' downstream enhancer is mediated by Sp1 and Smad3 factors, and would occur upon bending of the DNA intervening sequences. Thus, Sp1 would reinforce the promoter/enhancer contact, while Smad3 would stabilize the multifactorial complex by interacting with HIF-1/Sp1/HNF-4 and the coactivator CBP/p300. This model may be extended to other genes where collaboration between TGF-beta and hypoxia takes place.},

abstract = {Hypoxia, as occurs during tissue ischemia, tips the natural anticoagulant/procoagulant balance of the endovascular wall to favor activation of coagulation. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is an important factor suppressing fibrinolysis under conditions of low oxygen tension. We previously reported that hypoxia induced PAI-1 mRNA and antigen expression in murine macrophages secondary to increased de novo transcription as well as increased mRNA stability. We now show in RAW264.7 murine macrophages that the transcription factors early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) are quickly activated in hypoxia and are responsible for transcription and expression of PAI-1. Murine PAI-1 promoter constructs, including Egr, HIF-1alpha, and/or C/EBPalpha binding sites, were transfected into RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. To identify the relative importance of each of these putative hypoxia-responsive elements, cells were exposed to normobaric hypoxia, and transcriptional activity was recorded. At 16 h of hypoxic exposure, murine PAI-1 promoter deletion constructs that included Egr, HIF-1alpha, and/or C/EBPalpha binding sites demonstrated increased transcriptional activity. Mutation of each of these three murine PAI-1 promoter sites (or a combination of them) resulted in a marked reduction in hypoxia sensitivity as detected by transcriptional analysis. Functional data obtained using 32P-labeled Egr, HIF-1alpha response element (HRE), and C/EBPalpha oligonucleotides revealed induction of DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from hypoxic RAW cells, with supershift analysis confirming activation of Egr-1, HIF-1alpha, or C/EBPalpha. ChIP analysis confirmed the authenticity of these interactions as each of these transcription factors binds to chromatin under hypoxic conditions. Further, the induction of PAI-1 by Egr-1, HIF-1alpha, or C/EBPalpha was replicated in primary peritoneal macrophages. These data suggest that although HIF-1alpha appears to dominate the PAI-1 transcriptional response in hypoxia, Egr-1 and C/EBPalpha greatly augment this response and can do so independent of HIF-1alpha or each other. These studies are relevant to ischemic up-regulation of the PAI-1 gene and consequent accrual of microvascular thrombus under ischemic conditions.},

abstract = {Tumor hypoxia often directly correlates with aggressive phenotype, metastasis progression, and resistance to chemotherapy. Two transcription factors [hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and HIF-2alpha] are dramatically induced in hypoxic areas and regulate the expression of genes necessary for tumor adaptation to the conditions of low oxygen; however, the relative contribution of these factors is controversial. We used RNA interference-mediated inactivation of HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha followed by microarray analysis to identify genes specifically regulated by either HIF-1 or HIF-2 in hypoxia. We found that, in the MCF7 cell line, the vast majority of hypoxia-responsive genes ({\textgreater}80{\%}) were dependent on the presence of HIF-1alpha. However, a small group of genes were preferentially regulated by HIF-2alpha. Promoter analysis for this group of genes revealed that all of them have putative binding sites for ETS family transcription factors, and 10 of 11 HIF-2alpha-dependent genes had at least one potential hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) in proximity to an ETS transcription factor binding site. Knockdown of ELK-1, the most often represented member of ETS family, significantly reduced hypoxic induction of the HIF-2alpha-dependent genes. Physical and functional interaction between ELK-1 and HIF-2alpha were supported by coimmunoprecipitation of these two proteins, luciferase reporter assay using CITED2 promoter, and binding of ELK-1 protein to the promoters of CITED2 and WISP2 genes in proximity to a HRE. These data suggest that the choice of the target genes by HIF-1 or HIF-2 depends on availability and cooperation of HIFs with other factors recognizing their cognate elements in the promoters.},

abstract = {The oxygen-regulated control system responsible for the induction of erythropoietin (Epo) by hypoxia is present in most (if not all) cells and operates on other genes, including those involved in energy metabolism. To understand the organization of cis-acting sequences that are responsible for oxygen-regulated gene expression, we have studied the 5' flanking region of the mouse gene encoding the hypoxically inducible enzyme lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH). Deletional and mutational analysis of the function of mouse LDH-reporter fusion gene constructs in transient transfection assays defined three domains, between -41 and -84 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site, which were crucial for oxygen-regulated expression. The most important of these, although not capable of driving hypoxic induction in isolation, had the consensus of a hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) site, and cross-competed for the binding of HIF-1 with functionally active Epo and phosphoglycerate kinase-1 sequences. The second domain was positioned close to the HIF-1 site, in an analogous position to one of the critical regions in the Epo 3' hypoxic enhancer. The third domain had the motif of a cAMP response element (CRE). Activation of cAMP by forskolin had no effect on the level of LDH mRNA in normoxia, but produced a magnified response to hypoxia that was dependent upon the integrity of the CRE, indicating an interaction between inducible factors binding the HIF-1 and CRE sites.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor 1$\alpha$ (HIF-1$\alpha$) is frequently overexpressed in human cancers and controls the expression of several genes that have been implicated in tumor growth and progression. Activity of HIF-1$\alpha$ in cancer cells is regulated at the transcriptional, translational and posttranslational level by multiple inter- and coacting molecular pathways. In this report, we reveal for the first time that tumor-associated CpG demethylation facilitates positive autoregulation of HIF-1$\alpha$, resulting in amplification of hypoxia-induced transactivation of HIF-1$\alpha$ target genes. The HIF-1$\alpha$ promoter harbors a hypoxia response element that is normally repressed by methylation of a CpG dinucleotide located in the core element. In colon cancer cell lines and in primary colon cancer specimens, however, we found frequent aberrant demethylation of this element, enabling binding of HIF-1$\alpha$ to its own promoter resulting in autotransactivation of HIF-1$\alpha$ expression. Our results provide novel and highly unexpected insights into the complexity of HIF-1$\alpha$ regulation in cancer cells and implicate that tumor-associated CpG demethylation augments HIF-1$\alpha$-mediated effects on malignant cell growth.},

abstract = {Hypoxia, via the hypoxia-inducible factors 1 and 2 (HIF-1 and HIF-2), upregulates many genes involved in cell survival. However, proapoptotic pathways are also induced. BCL-2/adenovirus E1B-19 kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) represents a paradigm of a cell death protein that is hypoxically upregulated via HIF-1 in most cancers. We found that in contrast to many other cell types, 6/8 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines show little hypoxic induction of BNIP3 despite an intact HIF signalling system. Colorectal tumour tissue also loses BNIP3 expression relative to matched normal samples. Downregulation of hypoxic BNIP3 in CRC cells was independent of the expression of other BCL-2 family members, or BNIP3L. That BNIP3 plays a functional role in hypoxic survival in CRC cells was demonstrated by the fact that CRC cell lines that do not upregulate BNIP3 or have been treated with BNIP3 RNA interference were insensitive to hypoxia-induced cell death. Promoter methylation and histone deacetylation were shown to silence BNIP3 in these CRC cell lines. Of significance, hypoxic induction of BNIP3 was restored in 4/6 cell lines by trichostatin-A treatment alone. These data suggest that BNIP3 plays an important role in hypoxic cell death and epigenetic mechanisms selectively silence its expression in CRC.},

abstract = {The glycoprotein hormone Erythropoietin (EPO) stimulates red cell production and maturation. EPO is produced by the kidneys and the fetal liver in response to hypoxia (HOX). Recently, EPO expression has also been observed in the central nervous system where it may be neuroprotective. It remained unclear, however, whether EPO is expressed in the peripheral nervous system and, if so, whether a neuronal phenotype is required for its regulation. Herein, we report that EPO expression was induced by HOX and a HOX mimetic in two cell lines derived from neuroblastoma (NB), a tumor of the peripheral nervous system. Both cell lines with inducible EPO expression, SH-SY5Y and Kelly cells, expressed typical neuronal markers like neuropeptide Y (NPY), growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), and neuron-specific enolase (ENO). NB cells with a more epithelial phenotype like SH-SHEP and LAN-5 did not show HOX inducible EPO gene regulation. Still, oxygen sensing and up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) were intact in all cell lines. We found that CpG methylation of the HIF binding site (HBS) in the EPO gene 3' enhancer was only present in the SH-SHEP and LAN-5 cells but not in SH-SY5Y and Kelly cells with regulated EPO expression. The addition of recombinant EPO to all NB cells, both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, had no effect on cell proliferation. We conclude that the ability to respond to HOX with an increase in EPO expression in human NB may depend on CpG methylation and the differentiation status of these embryonic tumor cells but does not affect the proliferative characteristics of the cells.},

abstract = {The hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcriptional activator involved in the expression of oxygen-regulated genes such as that for erythropoietin. Following exposure to low oxygen partial pressure (hypoxia), HIF-1 binds to an hypoxia-response element located 3' to the erythropoietin gene and confers activation of erythropoietin expression. The conserved core HIF-1 binding site (HBS) of the erythropoietin 3' enhancer (CGTG) contains a CpG dinucleotide known to be a potential target of cytosine methylation. We found that methylation of the HBS abolishes HIF-1 DNA binding as well as hypoxic reporter gene activation, suggesting that a methylation-free HBS is mandatory for HIF-1 function. The in vivo methylation pattern of the erythropoietin 3' HBS in various human cell lines and mouse organs was assessed by genomic Southern blotting using a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme. Whereas this site was essentially methylation-free in the erythropoietin-producing cell line Hep3B, a direct correlation between erythropoietin protein expression and the degree of erythropoietin 3' HBS methylation was found in different HepG2 sublines. However, the finding that this site is partially methylation-free in human cell lines and mouse tissues that do not express erythropoietin suggests that there might be a general selective pressure to keep this site methylation-free, independent of erythropoietin expression.},

abstract = {The roles of the erythropoietin (Epo) 3' enhancer in the activation of gene expression in response to hypoxia were investigated. The enhancer contains hypoxia-inducible enhancer binding site 1 (HIF-1 element) and two direct repeats of hexanucleotide consensus nuclear receptor half site (HNF-4 element). HIF-1, which is a heterodimeric complex of HIF-1 alpha and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translecator (ARNT), binds to HIF-1 element. HNF-4 binds to HNF-4 element as a homodimeric complex. Studies on mutant reporter plasmids demonstrated that both HIF-1 alpha and HNF-4 elements were necessary for augmentation of the enhancer activity, since mutation of either the HIF-1 or the HNF-4 element caused loss of inducibility under hypoxic conditions. Mammalian two-hybrid experiments in vivo revealed that transitional change took place from the interaction of HNF-4 with ARNT to that with HIF-1 alpha in response to hypoxia. Such interactive domains were identified in amino acids 369-465 containing the C-terminal of HNF-4 and amino acids 1-458 containing basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and Per-ARNT-AHR-Sim (PAS) domains of ARNT in normoxia. Also, an extended sequence containing ligand and dimerization domains, and the C-terminal of HNF-4 (amino acids 135-465), and the PAS domain (amino acids 106-526) of HIF-1 alpha were used for the interaction between the two transcription factors in hypoxia. From these data, the functional significance of the transitional change in the augmentation of gene expression by the Epo enhancer in hypoxia is discussed.},

abstract = {Cancer cells are optimised for growth and survival via an ability to outcompete normal cells in their microenvironment. Many of these advantageous cellular adaptations are promoted by the pathophysiological hypoxia that arises in solid tumours due to incomplete vascularisation. Tumour cells are thus faced with the challenge of an increased need for nutrients to support the drive for proliferation in the face of a diminished extracellular supply. Among the many modifications occurring in tumour cells, hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) act as essential drivers of key pro-survival pathways via the promotion of numerous membrane and cytosolic proteins. Here we focus our attention on two areas: the role of amino acid uptake and the handling of metabolic acid (CO2/H+) production. We provide evidence for a number of hypoxia-induced proteins that promote cellular anabolism and regulation ofmetabolic acid–base levels in tumour cells including amino-acid transporters (LAT1), monocarboxylate transporters, and acid–base regulating carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and bicarbonate transporters (NBCs). Emphasis is placed on current work manipulating multiple CA isoforms and NBCs, which is at an interesting crossroads of gas physiology as they are regulated by hypoxia to contribute to the cellular handling of CO2 and pHi regulation. Our research combined with others indicates that targeting of HIF-regulated membrane proteins in tumour cells will provide promising future anti-cancer therapeutic approaches and we suggest strategies that could be potentially used to enhance these tactics.},

Here, we report the generation of a transgenic mouse model of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) renal cancer termed the TRACK model (transgenic model of cancer of the kidney). TRACK mice specifically express a mutated, constitutively active HIF1$\alpha$ in kidney proximal tubule (PT) cells. Kidney histologies displayed by TRACK mice are highly similar to histologies seen in patients with VHL disease, including areas of distorted tubular structure, cells with clear cytoplasm and increased glycogen and lipid deposition, multiple renal cysts, and early onset of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Distorted tubules in TRACK mice exhibit higher levels of CA-IX, Glut1, and VEGF than tubules in nontransgenic control mice. Furthermore, these tubules exhibit increased numbers of endothelial cells, increased cell proliferation, and increased expression of the human ccRCC marker CD70(TNFSF7). Moreover, PT cells in kidney tubules from TRACK mice exhibit increased genomic instability, as monitored by elevated levels of $\gamma$H2AX. Our findings establish that activated HIF1$\alpha$ in murine kidney PT cells is sufficient to promote cell proliferation, angiogenesis, genomic instability, and other phenotypic alterations characteristic of human VHL kidney disease, establishing the TRACK mouse as a valid preclinical model of human renal cell carcinoma.},

Here, we find that kidney-specific deletion of Vhl and Pbrm1, but not either gene alone, results in bilateral, multifocal, transplantable clear cell kidney cancers. PBRM1 loss amplified the transcriptional outputs of HIF1 and STAT3 incurred by Vhl deficiency. Analysis of mouse and human ccRCC revealed convergence on mTOR activation, representing the third driver event after genetic inactivation of VHL and PBRM1. Our study reports a physiological preclinical ccRCC mouse model that recapitulates somatic mutations in human ccRCC and provides mechanistic and therapeutic insights into PBRM1 mutated subtypes of human ccRCC.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 UICC. Colorectal cancer results from the malignant transformation of colonic epithelial cells. Stromal fibroblasts are the main component of the tumour microenvironment, and play an important role in the progression of this and other neoplasias. Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signalling is essential for colon homeostasis, but aberrant, constitutive activation of this pathway is a hallmark of colorectal cancer. Here we present the first transcriptomic study on the effect of a Wnt factor on human colonic myofibroblasts. Wnt3A regulates the expression of 1,136 genes, of which 662 are upregulated and 474 are downregulated in CCD-18Co cells. A set of genes encoding inhibitors of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway stand out among those induced by Wnt3A, which suggests that there is a feedback inhibitory mechanism. We also show that the PKP2 gene encoding the desmosomal protein Plakophilin-2 is a novel direct transcriptional target of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin in normal and colon cancer-associated fibroblasts. PKP2 is induced by $\beta$-catenin/TCF through three binding sites in the gene promoter and one additional binding site located in an enhancer 20 kb upstream from the transcription start site. Moreover, Plakophilin-2 antagonizes Wnt/$\beta$-catenin transcriptional activity in HEK-293T cells, which suggests that it may act as an intracellular inhibitor of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway. Our results demonstrate that stromal fibroblasts respond to canonical Wnt signalling and that Plakophilin-2 plays a role in the feedback control of this effect suggesting that the response to Wnt factors in the stroma may modulate Wnt activity in the tumour cells.},

Similarly, the RICK-related kinase RIP associated via its intermediate region with IKK$\gamma$. A mutant form of IKK$\gamma$ deficient in binding to IKK$\alpha$ and IKK$\beta$ inhibited NF-$\kappa$B activation induced by RICK or RIP. Enforced oligomerization of RICK or RIP as well as of IKK$\gamma$, IKK$\alpha$, or IKK$\beta$ was sufficient for induction of NF-$\kappa$B activation. Thus, the proximity of RICK, RIP, and IKK complexes may play an important role for NF-$\kappa$B activation during Nod1 oligomerization or trimerization of the tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ receptor.},

abstract = {Cellular responses to low oxygen tension are mediated, at least in part, by the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). In the presence of oxygen, specific HIF residues become hydroxylated by the action of a recently described group of dioxygenases. These post-translational modifications target HIF for proteosomal degradation and prevent its transcriptional activity. Despite these detailed studies, little is known about the regulation of HIF by stimuli other than hypoxia. Here we report that, in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation results in a decrease of both basal and hypoxia-induced levels of HIF-2$\alpha$ protein. NGF treatment did not increase HIF-hydroxylase gene expression or activity, and the reduction of the HIF-2$\alpha$ protein level upon stimulation was observed even in the presence of HIF-hydroxylase inhibitors such as deferoxamine or dimethyloxoglutarate. Thus, in contrast to the response to hypoxia, the effect of NGF on HIF-2$\alpha$ protein levels is not mediated by the HIF hydroxilases. Quantitative real time (RT)-PCR showed that NGF stimulation results in a decrease of the HIF-2$\alpha$ mRNA level similar to that found at the protein level. Interestingly, NGF effect was specific for HIF-2$\alpha$ mRNA because it did not affect HIF-1$\alpha$ mRNA levels. NGF treatment reduced HIF-2$\alpha$ mRNA levels even in the presence of actinomycin D, suggesting an effect on mRNA stability. Finally, the effect of NGF on HIF2$\alpha$ correlates with reduction of both basal and hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA levels. Reporter assays suggest that the reduced expression of hypoxia-inducible genes upon NGF treatment is related, at least in part, to the reduction of HIF-2$\alpha$ protein. Hence, in PC12 cells the level of HIF-2$\alpha$ protein and its effect on gene expression can be down-regulated by stimuli other than oxygen.},

abstract = {Most of the genes induced by hypoxia are regulated by a family of transcription factors termed hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF). Under normoxic conditions, HIF$\alpha$ proteins are very unstable due to hydroxylation by a recently described family of proline hydroxylases termed EGL-Nine homologs (EGLN). Upon hydroxylation, HIF$\alpha$ is recognized by the product of the tumor suppressor vhl and targeted for proteosomal degradation. Since EGLNs require oxygen to catalize HIF hydroxylation, this reaction does not efficiently occur under low oxygen tension. Thus, under hypoxia, HIF$\alpha$ escapes from degradation and transcribes target genes. The mRNA levels of two of the three EGLNs described to date are induced by hypoxia, suggesting that they might be novel HIF target genes; however, no proof for this hypothesis has been reported. Here we show that the induction of EGLN1 and -3 by hypoxia is found in a wide range of cell types. The basal levels of EGLN3 are always well below those of EGLN1 and EGLN2, and its induction by hypoxia is larger than that found for EGLN1. The inhibitor of transcription, actinomycin D, prevents the increase of EGLN3 mRNA induced by hypoxia, indicating that it is due to enhanced gene expression. Interestingly, EGLN1 and EGLN3 mRNAs were also triggered by EGLN inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of HIF$\alpha$ in the control of its transcription. In agreement with this possibility, pVHL-deficient cell lines, which present high HIF activity under normoxia, also showed dramatically increased normoxic levels of EGLN3. Moreover, the overexpression of an oxygen-insensitive mutant form of HIF$\alpha$ resulted in increased normoxic levels of EGLN3 mRNA. Finally, hypoxic induction of EGLNs was not observed in cells lacking functional HIF$\alpha$. {\textcopyright} 2003 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Cell proliferation is regulated by an appropriate combination of intracellular signals involving activation of kinases and the generation of phospholipid metabolites. We report here that growth factors induce a biphasic generation of phosphorylcholine (PCho) in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells, resulting in an early and transient increase at 100 s and a larger and sustained increase after 3 h of stimulation. Generation of PCho at both early and late times of growth factors stimulation results from the consecutive activation of phospholipase D (PLD) and choline kinase (ChoK). Production of PCho by specific growth factors seems an essential requirement for the early signals associated to activation of Raf‐1 and MAP kinases, since blockage of choline kinase completely inhibited activation of Raf‐1 and MAP kinases by PDGF or FGF. Both the transient early increase and the late sustained increase in PCho are required for the induction of DNA‐synthesis, besides completion of the activation of the serine/threonine kinases cascade. Thus, our results strongly suggest that generation of PCho by the PLD/choline kinase pathway is one of the critical steps in regulating cell growth in NIH 3T3 stimulated by growth factors.

To dissect Pol II dynamics in mouse ES cells, we inhibited Pol II transcription at either initiation or promoter-proximal pause escape with Triptolide or Flavopiridol, and tracked Pol II kinetically using GRO-seq. Both inhibitors block transcription of more than 95{\%} of genes, showing that pause escape, like initiation, is a ubiquitous and crucial step within the transcription cycle. Moreover, paused Pol II is relatively stable, as evidenced from half-life measurements at ∼3200 genes. Finally, tracking the progression of Pol II after drug treatment establishes Pol II elongation rates at over 1000 genes. Notably, Pol II accelerates dramatically while transcribing through genes, but slows at exons. Furthermore, intergenic variance in elongation rates is substantial, and is influenced by a positive effect of H3K79me2 and negative effects of exon density and CG content within genes.},

abstract = {The completion of the human genome sequence in 2003 clearly marked the beginning of a new era for biomedical research. It spurred technological progress that was unprecedented in the life sciences, including the development of high-throughput technologies to detect genetic variation and gene expression. The study of genetics has become "big data science". One of the current goals of genetic research is to use genomic information to further our understanding of common complex diseases. An essential first step made towards this goal was by the identification of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms showing robust association with hundreds of different traits and diseases. As insight into common genetic variation has expanded enormously and the technology to identify more rare variation has become available, we can utilize these advances to gain a better understanding of disease etiology. This will lead to developments in personalized medicine and P4 healthcare. Here, we review some of the historical events and perspectives before and after the completion of the human genome sequence. We also describe the success of large-scale genetic association studies and how these are expected to yield more insight into complex disorders. We show how we can now combine gene-oriented research and systems-based approaches to develop more complex models to help explain the etiology of common diseases.

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have shown a large number of genetic variants to be associated with complex diseases. The identification of the causal variant within an associated locus can sometimes be difficult because of the linkage disequilibrium between the associated variants and because most GWAS loci contain multiple genes, or no genes at all. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping is a method used to determine the effects of genetic variants on gene expression levels. eQTL mapping studies have enabled the prioritization of genetic variants within GWAS loci, and have shown that trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) often function in a tissue- or cell type-specific manner, sometimes having downstream effects on completely different chromosomes. Furthermore, recent RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) studies have shown that a large repertoire of transcripts is available in cells, which are actively regulated by (trait-associated) variants. Future eQTL mapping studies will focus on broadening the range of available tissues and cell types, in order to determine the key tissues and cell types involved in complex traits. Finally, large meta-analyses will be able to pinpoint the causal variants within the trait-associated loci and determine their downstream effects in greater detail.

In gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a score that can combine fold change and P-value together is needed for better gene ranking.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We defined a gene significance score $\pi$-value by combining expression fold change and statistical significance (P-value), and explored its statistical properties. When compared to various existing methods, $\pi$-value based approach is more robust in selecting DE genes, with the largest area under curve in its receiver operating characteristic curve. We applied $\pi$-value to GSEA and found it comparable to P-value and t-statistic based methods, with added protection against false discovery in certain situations. Finally, in a gene functional study of breast cancer profiles, we showed that using $\pi$-value helps elucidating otherwise overlooked important biological functions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: http://gccri.uthscsa.edu/Pi{\_}Value{\_}Supplementary.asp$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: xy@ieee.org, cheny8@uthscsa.edu$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {The challenge of linking intergenic mutations to target genes has limited molecular understanding of human diseases. Here, we show that H3K27ac HiChIP generates high-resolution contact maps of active enhancers and target genes in rare primary human T cell subtypes and coronary artery smooth muscle cells. Differentiation of naive T cells to T helper 17 cells or regulatory T cells creates subtype-specific enhancer-promoter interactions, specifically at regions of shared DNA accessibility. These data provide a principled means of assigning molecular functions to autoimmune and cardiovascular disease risk variants, linking hundreds of noncoding variants to putative gene targets. Target genes identified with HiChIP are further supported by CRISPR interference and activation at linked enhancers, by the presence of expression quantitative trait loci, and by allele-specific enhancer loops in patient-derived primary cells. The majority of disease-associated enhancers contact genes beyond the nearest gene in the linear genome, leading to a four-fold increase of potential target genes for autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases.},

abstract = {In addition to controlling a switch to glycolytic metabolism and induction of erythropoiesis and angiogenesis, hypoxia promotes the undifferentiated cell state in various stem and precursor cell populations. Here, we show that the latter process requires Notch signaling. Hypoxia blocks neuronal and myogenic differentiation in a Notch-dependent manner. Hypoxia activates Notch-responsive promoters and increases expression of Notch direct downstream genes. The Notch intracellular domain interacts with HIF-1alpha, a global regulator of oxygen homeostasis, and HIF-1alpha is recruited to Notch-responsive promoters upon Notch activation under hypoxic conditions. Taken together, these data provide molecular insights into how reduced oxygen levels control the cellular differentiation status and demonstrate a role for Notch in this process.},

@article{Zaret2011,
abstract = {Transcription factors are adaptor molecules that detect regulatory sequences in the DNA and target the assembly of protein complexes that control gene expression. Yet much of the DNA in the eukaryotic cell is in nucleosomes and thereby occluded by histones, and can be further occluded by higher-order chromatin structures and repressor complexes. Indeed, genome-wide location analyses have revealed that, for all transcription factors tested, the vast majority of potential DNA-binding sites are unoccupied, demonstrating the inaccessibility of most of the nuclear DNA. This raises the question of how target sites at silent genes become bound de novo by transcription factors, thereby initiating regulatory events in chromatin. Binding cooperativity can be sufficient for many kinds of factors to simultaneously engage a target site in chromatin and activate gene expression. However, in cases in which the binding of a series of factors is sequential in time and thus not initially cooperative, special "pioneer transcription factors" can be the first to engage target sites in chromatin. Such initial binding can passively enhance transcription by reducing the number of additional factors that are needed to bind the DNA, culminating in activation. In addition, pioneer factor binding can actively open up the local chromatin and directly make it competent for other factors to bind. Passive and active roles for the pioneer factor FoxA occur in embryonic development, steroid hormone induction, and human cancers. Herein we review the field and describe how pioneer factors may enable cellular reprogramming.},

However, population genetic theory, combined with the data of comparative genomics, clearly indicates that such a "pan-adaptationist" approach is a fallacy. The proper question is: how has this sequence evolved? And the proper null hypothesis posits that it is a result of neutral evolution: that is, it survives by sheer chance provided that it is not deleterious enough to be efficiently purged by purifying selection. To claim adaptation, the neutral null has to be falsified. The adaptationist fallacy can be costly, inducing biologists to relentlessly seek function where there is none.},

abstract = {Chromosomal crossover is a biological mechanism to combine parental traits. It is perhaps the first mechanism ever taught in any introductory biology class. The formulation of crossover, and resulting recombination, came about 100 years after Mendel's famous experiments. To a great extent, this formulation is consistent with the basic genetic findings of Mendel. More importantly, it provides a mathematical insight for his two laws (and corrects them). From a mathematical perspective, and while it retains similarities, genetic recombination guarantees diversity so that we do not rapidly converge to the same being. It is this diversity that made the study of biology possible. In particular, the problem of genetic mapping and linkage-one of the first efforts towards a computational approach to biology-relies heavily on the mathematical foundation of crossover and recombination. Nevertheless, as students we often overlook the mathematics of these phenomena. Emphasizing the mathematical aspect of Mendel's laws through crossover and recombination will prepare the students to make an early realization that biology, in addition to being experimental, IS a computational science. This can serve as a first step towards a broader curricular transformation in teaching biological sciences. I will show that a simple and modern treatment of Mendel's laws using a Markov chain will make this step possible, and it will only require basic college-level probability and calculus. My personal teaching experience confirms that students WANT to know Markov chains because they hear about them from bioinformaticists all the time. This entire exposition is based on three homework problems that I designed for a course in computational biology. A typical reader is, therefore, an instructional staff member or a student in a computational field (e.g., computer science, mathematics, statistics, computational biology, bioinformatics). However, other students may easily follow by omitting the mathematically more elaborate parts. I kept those as separate sections in the exposition.},

abstract = {Bioinformatics is becoming increasingly central to research in the life sciences. However, despite its importance, bioinformatics skills and knowledge are not well integrated in undergraduate biology education. This curricular gap prevents biology students from harnessing the full potential of their education, limiting their career opportunities and slowing genomic research innovation. To advance the integration of bioinformatics into life sciences education, a framework of core bioinformatics competencies is needed. To that end, we here report the results of a survey of life sciences faculty in the United States about teaching bioinformatics to undergraduate life scientists. Responses were received from 1,260 faculty representing institutions in all fifty states with a combined capacity to educate hundreds of thousands of students every year. Results indicate strong, widespread agreement that bioinformatics knowledge and skills are critical for undergraduate life scientists, as well as considerable agreement about which skills are necessary. Perceptions of the importance of some skills varied with the respondent{\&}{\#}039;s degree of training, time since degree earned, and/or the Carnegie classification of the respondent{\&}{\#}039;s institution. To assess which skills are currently being taught, we analyzed syllabi of courses with bioinformatics content submitted by survey respondents. Finally, we used the survey results, the analysis of syllabi, and our collective research and teaching expertise to develop a set of bioinformatics core competencies for undergraduate life sciences students. These core competencies are intended to serve as a guide for institutions as they work to integrate bioinformatics into their life sciences curricula.},

abstract = {Mammalian genomes are punctuated by DNA sequences containing an atypically high frequency of CpG sites termed CpG islands (CGIs). CGIs generally lack DNA methylation and associate with the majority of annotated gene promoters. Many studies, however, have identified examples of CGI methylation in malignant cells, leading to improper gene silencing. CGI methylation also occurs in normal tissues and is known to function in X-inactivation and genomic imprinting. More recently, differential methylation has been shown between tissues, suggesting a potential role in transcriptional regulation during cell specification. Many of these tissue-specific methylated CGIs localise to regions distal to promoters, the regulatory function of which remains to be determined. {\textcopyright} 2009 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

abstract = {Hypoxia‐inducible factor (HIF) directs an extensive transcriptional cascade that transduces numerous adaptive responses to hypoxia. Pan‐genomic analyses, using chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcript profiling, have revealed large numbers of HIF‐binding sites that are generally associated with hypoxia‐inducible transcripts, even over long chromosomal distances. However, these studies do not define the specific targets of HIF‐binding sites and do not reveal how induction of HIF affects chromatin conformation over distantly connected functional elements. To address these questions, we deployed a recently developed chromosome conformation assay that enables simultaneous high‐resolution analyses from multiple viewpoints. These assays defined specific long‐range interactions between intergenic HIF‐binding regions and one or more promoters of hypoxia‐inducible genes, revealing the existence of multiple enhancer–promoter, promoter–enhancer, and enhancer–enhancer interactions. However, neither short‐term activation of HIF by hypoxia, nor long‐term stabilization of HIF in von Hippel–Lindau (VHL)‐defective cells greatly alters these interactions, indicating that at least under these conditions, HIF can operate on preexisting patterns of chromatin–chromatin interactions that define potential transcriptional targets and permit rapid gene activation by hypoxic stress.},

Characterization of the changes after various stimuli at different -omics levels is crucial to comprehend the adaptation of cells to the changing conditions. Genome-wide quantification and analysis of transcript levels, the genes affected by perturbations, extends our understanding of cellular metabolism by pointing out the mechanisms that play role in sensing the stress caused by those perturbations and related signaling pathways, and in this way guides us to achieve endeavors, such as rational engineering of cells or interpretation of disease mechanisms. Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system has been studied in response to different perturbations and corresponding transcriptional profiles were followed either statically or/and dynamically, short and long term. This review focuses on response of yeast cells to diverse stress inducing perturbations, including nutritional changes, ionic stress, salt stress, oxidative stress, osmotic shock, and to genetic interventions such as deletion and overexpression of genes. It is aimed to conclude on common regulatory phenomena that allow yeast to organize its transcriptomic response after any perturbation under different external conditions.},

abstract = {RATIONALE Global Lung Function Initiative recommends reporting lung function measures as z-score, and a classification of airflow limitation (AL) based on this parameter has recently been proposed. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the prognostic capacity of the AL classifications based on z-score or percentage predicted in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS A cohort of 2614 COPD patients recruited outside the hospital setting was examined after 57±13 months of follow-up, totalling 10,322 person-years. All-cause mortality was analysed, evaluating the predictive capacity of several AL staging systems. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Based on GOLD guidelines, 461 patients (17.6{\%}) had mild, 1452 (55.5{\%}) moderate, 590 (22.6{\%}) severe, and 111 (4.2{\%}) very severe AL. According to z-score classification, 66.3{\%} of patients remained with the same severity, while 23.7{\%} worsened and 10.0{\%} improved. Unlike other staging systems, patients with severe AL according to z-score had higher mortality than those with very severe AL (increase of risk by 5.2 and 3.9 times compared with mild AL, respectively). The predictive capacity for 5-year survival was slightly higher for FEV1 expressed as percentage of predicted than as z-score (areas under the curves: 0.714-0.760 versus 0.649-0.708, respectively). A severity-dependent relationship between AL grades by z-score and mortality was only detected in patients under the age of 60. CONCLUSIONS In COPD patients, the AL classification based on z-score predicts worse mortality than those based on percentage of predicted. It is possible that the z-score underestimates AL severity in patients over 60 years of age with severe functional impairment. .},

abstract = {Cell proliferation is regulated by an appropriate combination of intracellular signals involving activation of kinases and the generation of phospholipid metabolites. We report here that growth factors induce a biphasic generation of phosphorylcholine (PCho) in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells, resulting in an early and transient increase at 100 s and a larger and sustained increase after 3 h of stimulation. Generation of PCho at both early and late times of growth factors stimulation results from the consecutive activation of phospholipase D (PLD) and choline kinase (ChoK). Production of PCho by specific growth factors seems an essential requirement for the early signals associated to activation of Raf-1 and MAP kinases, since blockage of choline kinase completely inhibited activation of Raf-1 and MAP kinases by PDGF or FGF. Both the transient early increase and the late sustained increase in PCho are required for the induction of DNA-synthesis, besides completion of the activation of the serine/threonine kinases cascade. Thus, our results strongly suggest that generation of PCho by the PLD/choline kinase pathway is one of the critical steps in regulating cell growth in NIH 3T3 stimulated by growth factors.},

Un-physiological activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is an early event in most renal cell cancers (RCC) following inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor. Despite intense study, how this impinges on cancer development is incompletely understood. To test for the impact of genetic signals on this pathway, we aligned human RCC-susceptibility polymorphisms with genome-wide assays of HIF-binding and observed highly significant overlap. Allele-specific assays of HIF binding, chromatin conformation and gene expression together with eQTL analyses in human tumors were applied to mechanistic analysis of one such overlapping site at chromosome 12p12.1. This defined a novel stage-specific mechanism in which the risk polymorphism, rs12814794, directly creates a new HIF-binding site that mediates HIF-1$\alpha$ isoform specific upregulation of its target BHLHE41. The alignment of multiple sites in the HIF cis-acting apparatus with RCC-susceptibility polymorphisms strongly supports a causal model in which minor variation in this pathway exerts significant effects on RCC development.},

We define the precise composition of the Sin3a complex in multiple cell types and identify the Fam60a subunit as a key defining feature of a variant Sin3a complex present in ES cells, which also contains Ogt and Tet1. Fam60a binds on H3K4me3-positive promoters in ES cells, together with Ogt, Tet1 and Sin3a, and is essential to maintain the complex on chromatin. Finally, we show that depletion of Fam60a phenocopies the loss of Sin3a, leading to reduced proliferation, an extended G1-phase and the deregulation of lineage genes. Taken together, Fam60a is an essential core subunit of a variant Sin3a complex in ES cells that is required to promote rapid proliferation and prevent unscheduled differentiation.},

abstract = {Acute stress puts cells at risk, and rapid adaptation is crucial for maximizing cell survival. Cellular adaptation mechanisms include modification of certain aspects of cell physiology, such as the induction of efficient changes in the gene expression programmes by intracellular signalling networks. Recent studies using genome-wide approaches as well as single-cell transcription measurements, in combination with classical genetics, have shown that rapid and specific activation of gene expression can be accomplished by several different strategies. This article discusses how organisms can achieve generic and specific responses to different stresses by regulating gene expression at multiple stages of mRNA biogenesis from chromatin structure to transcription, mRNA stability and translation.},

abstract = {Time is of the essence in biology as in so much else. For example, monitoring disease progression or the timing of developmental defects is important for the processes of drug discovery and therapy trials. Furthermore, an understanding of the basic dynamics of biological phenomena that are often strictly time regulated (e.g. circadian rhythms) is needed to make accurate inferences about the evolution of biological processes. Recent advances in technologies have enabled us to measure timing effects more accurately and in more detail. This has driven related advances in visualization and analysis tools that try to effectively exploit this data. Beyond timeline plots, notable attempts at more involved temporal interpretation have been made in recent years, but awareness of the available resources is still limited within the scientific community. Here, we review some advances in biological visualization of time-driven processes and consider how they aid data analysis and interpretation.},

abstract = {The ENCODE Project has generated a wealth of experimental information mapping diverse chromatin properties in several human cell lines. Although each such data track is independently informative toward the annotation of regulatory elements, their interrelations contain much richer information for the systematic annotation of regulatory elements. To uncover these interrelations and to generate an interpretable summary of the massive datasets of the ENCODE Project, we apply unsupervised learning methodologies, converting dozens of chromatin datasets into discrete annotation maps of regulatory regions and other chromatin elements across the human genome. These methods rediscover and summarize diverse aspects of chromatin architecture, elucidate the interplay between chromatin activity and RNA transcription, and reveal that a large proportion of the genome lies in a quiescent state, even across multiple cell types. The resulting annotation of non-coding regulatory elements correlate strongly with mammalian evolutionary constraint, and provide an unbiased approach for evaluating metrics of evolutionary constraint in human. Lastly, we use the regulatory annotations to revisit previously uncharacterized disease-associated loci, resulting in focused, testable hypotheses through the lens of the chromatin landscape.},

As acetylation is a histone mark for active transcription, HATs have been associated with active and HDACs with inactive genes. We describe here genome-wide mapping of HATs and HDACs binding on chromatin and find that both are found at active genes with acetylated histones. Our data provide evidence that HATs and HDACs are both targeted to transcribed regions of active genes by phosphorylated RNA Pol II. Furthermore, the majority of HDACs in the human genome function to reset chromatin by removing acetylation at active genes. Inactive genes that are primed by MLL-mediated histone H3K4 methylation are subject to a dynamic cycle of acetylation and deacetylation by transient HAT/HDAC binding, preventing Pol II from binding to these genes but poising them for future activation. Silent genes without any H3K4 methylation signal show no evidence of being bound by HDACs.},

abstract = {A sufficient supply molecular oxygen is essential for the maintenance of physiologic metabolism and bioenergetic homeostasis for most metazoans. For this reason, mechanisms have evolved for eukaryotic cells to adapt to conditions where oxygen demand exceeds supply (hypoxia). These mechanisms rely on the modification of pre-existing proteins, translational arrest and transcriptional changes. The hypoxia inducible factor (HIF; a master regulator of gene induction in response to hypoxia) is responsible for the majority of induced gene expression in hypoxia. However, much less is known about the mechanism(s) responsible for gene repression, an essential part of the adaptive transcriptional response. Hypoxia-induced gene repression leads to a reduction in energy demanding processes and the redirection of limited energetic resources to essential housekeeping functions. Recent developments have underscored the importance of transcriptional repressors in cellular adaptation to hypoxia. To date, at least ten distinct transcriptional repressors have been reported to demonstrate sensitivity to hypoxia. Central among these is the Repressor Element-1 Silencing Transcription factor (REST), which regulates over 200 genes. In this review, written to honor the memory and outstanding scientific legacy of Lorenz Poellinger, we provide an overview of our existing knowledge with respect to transcriptional repressors and their target genes in hypoxia.},

abstract = {0 0 M o n t h 2 0 1 7 | V o L 0 0 0 | n A t U R E | 1 Synthetic biology aims to develop engineering-driven approaches to the programming of cellular functions that could yield transformative technologies 1 . Synthetic gene circuits that combine DNA, protein, and RNA components have demonstrated a range of functions such as bistability 2 , oscillation 3,4 , feedback 5,6 , and logic capabilities 7–15 . However, it remains challenging to scale up these circuits owing to the limited number of designable, orthogonal, high-performance parts, the empirical and often tedious composition rules, and the requirements for substantial resources for encoding and operation. Here, we report a strategy for constructing RNA-only nanodevices to evaluate complex logic in living cells. Our 'ribocomputing' systems are composed of de-novo-designed parts and operate through predictable and designable base-pairing rules, allowing the effective in silico design of computing devices with prescribed configurations and functions in complex cellular environments. These devices operate at the post-transcriptional level and use an extended RNA transcript to co-localize all circuit sensing, computation, signal transduction, and output elements in the same self-assembled molecular complex, which reduces diffusion-mediated signal losses, lowers metabolic cost, and improves circuit reliability. We demonstrate that ribocomputing devices in Escherichia coli can evaluate two-input logic with a dynamic range up to 900-fold and scale them to four-input AND, six-input OR, and a complex 12-input expression (A1 AND A2 AND NOT A1*) OR (B1 AND B2 AND NOT B2*) OR (C1 AND C2) OR (D1 AND D2) OR (E1 AND E2). Successful operation of ribocomputing devices based on programmable RNA interactions suggests that systems employing the same design principles could be implemented in other host organisms or in extracellular settings. A wide variety of synthetic biological circuits have been constructed to endow cells with functions analogous to those of electronic circuits. A long-term goal of these efforts has been to develop biological circuit design strategies that will enable cellular function to be programmed with the same ease with which we program electronic computers. This conceptual framework has motivated efforts to develop libraries of well-characterized, modular, and composable biological parts that, in principle, can be assembled to construct new types of circuitry in living cells. Furthermore, it has spurred the adoption of layered circuit designs 11,16,17},

Genes regulated by stimuli as diverse as external signals (PHO5), cell differentiation processes (SPO11 and SPO13), cell type (RME1, FUS1, HO, TY2, STE6, STE3, and BAR1), and genes whose regulatory signals remain unknown (TRK2) depend on RPD1 to achieve maximal states of transcriptional regulation. RPD1 enhances both positive and negative regulation of these genes: in rpd1 delta mutants, higher levels of expression are observed under repression conditions and lower levels are observed under activation conditions. We show that several independent genetic screens, designed to identify yeast transcriptional regulators, have detected the RPD1 locus (also known as SIN3, SD11, and UME4). The inferred RPD1 protein contains four regions predicted to take on helix-loop-helix-like secondary structures and three regions (acidic, glutamine rich, and proline rich) reminiscent of the activating domains of transcriptional activators.},

abstract = {Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) catalyzes heme breakdown, eventually releasing iron, carbon monoxide, and bilirubin IXalpha. HO-1 is induced by its substrate heme and various environmental factors, which represents a protective response against oxidative stresses. Here we show that hypoxia represses HO-1 expression in three human cell types but induces it in rat, bovine, and monkey cells, indicating the inter-species difference in the hypoxic regulation of HO-1 expression. The hypoxia-mediated repression of HO-1 expression is consistently associated with the induction of Bach1, a heme-regulated transcriptional repressor, in human cells. Bach1 is a basic leucine zipper protein, forming a heterodimer with a small Maf protein. Expression of HO-1 was also reduced in human cells when exposed to interferon-gamma or an iron chelator desferrioxamine, each of which induced Bach1 expression. In contrast, induction of HO-1 expression by CoCl(2) is associated with reduced expression of Bach1 mRNA. Thus, expression of HO-1 and Bach1 is inversely regulated. We have identified a Maf recognition element in the human HO-1 gene that is required for repression of a reporter gene by hypoxia and targeted by Bach1. Therefore, Bach1 functions as a hypoxia-inducible repressor for the HO-1 gene, thereby contributing to fine-tuning of oxygen homeostasis in human cells.},

Recessive mutations in RPD1 and RPD3 suppress the TRK2, conferring an approximately fourfold increase in transcription. rpd3 mutations confer pleiotropic phenotypes, including (i) mating defects, (ii) hypersensitivity to cycloheximide, (iii) inability to sporulate as homozygous diploids, and (iv) constitutive derepression of acid phosphatase. RPD3 was cloned and is predicted to encode a 48-kDa protein with no extensive similarity to proteins contained in current data bases. Deletion of RPD3 is not lethal but confers phenotypes identical to those caused by spontaneous mutations. RPD3 is required for both full repression and full activation of transcription of target genes including PHO5, STE6, and TY2. RPD3 is the second gene required for this function, since RPD1 is also required. The effects of mutations in RPD1 and RPD3 are not additive, suggesting that these genes are involved in the same transcriptional regulatory function or pathway.},

Here, we find that the??SIN3A/HDAC corepressor complex maintains ESC pluripotency and promotes the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Members of the SIN3A/HDAC corepressor complex are enriched in an extended NANOG interactome and function in transcriptional coactivation in ESCs. We also identified a critical role for SIN3A and HDAC2 in efficient reprogramming of somatic cells. Mechanistically, NANOG and SIN3A co-occupy transcriptionally active pluripotency genes in ESCs and also co-localize extensively at their genome-wide targets in pre-iPSCs. Additionally, both factors are required to directly induce a synergistic transcriptional program wherein pluripotency genes are activated and reprogramming barrier genes are repressed. Our findings indicate a transcriptional regulatory role for a??major HDAC-containing complex in promoting pluripotency.},

@article{Wu2015a,
abstract = {ChIP seq is a widely used assay to measure genome-wide protein binding. The decrease in costs associated with sequencing has led to a rise in the number of studies that investigate protein binding across treatment conditions or cell lines. In addition to the identification of binding sites, new studies evaluate the variation in protein binding between conditions. A number of approaches to study differential transcription factor binding have recently been developed. Several of these methods build upon established methods from RNA-seq to quantify differences in read counts. We compare how these new approaches perform on different data sets from the ENCODE project to illustrate the impact of data processing pipelines under different study designs. The performance of normalization methods for differential ChIP-seq depends strongly on the variation in total amount of protein bound between conditions, with total read count outperforming effective library size, or variants thereof, when a large variation in binding was studied. Use of input subtraction to correct for non-specific binding showed a relatively modest impact on the number of differential peaks found and the fold change accuracy to biological validation, however a larger impact might be expected for samples with more extreme copy number variations between them. Still, it did identify a small subset of novel differential regions while excluding some differential peaks in regions with high background signal. These results highlight proper scaling for between-sample data normalization as critical for differential transcription factor binding analysis and suggest bioinformaticians need to know about the variation in level of total protein binding between conditions to select the best analysis method. At the same time, validation using fold-change estimates from qRT-PCR suggests there is still room for further method improvement.},

Although classic repressors undoubtedly silence transcription, genome-wide studies have shown that many repressors are associated with actively transcribed loci and that this is a widespread phenomenon. Here, we review the evidence for the presence of repressors at actively transcribed regions and assess what roles they might be playing. We propose that the modulation of expression levels by chromatin-modifying, co-repressor complexes provides transcriptional fine-tuning that drives development.},

Physiol. 87(5): 1990–1995, 1999.—This study was designed to determine whether chronic chemical activation of AMP- activated protein kinase (AMPK) would increase glucose transporter GLUT-4 and hexokinase in muscles similarly to periodic elevation of AMPK that accompanies endurance exercise training. The adenosine analog, 5-aminoimidazole-4- carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), has previously been shown to be taken up by cells and phosphorylated to form a compound (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide) that mimics the effect of AMP on AMPK. A single injection of AICAR resulted in a marked increase in AMPK in epitrochle- aris and gastrocnemius/plantaris muscles 60 min later. When rats were injected with AICAR (1 mg/g body wt) for 5 days in succession and were killed 1 day after the last injection, GLUT-4 was increased by 100{\%} in epitrochlearis muscle and by 60{\%} in gastrocnemius muscle in response to AICAR. Hexokinase was also increased 2.5-fold in the gastrocnemius/ plantaris. Gastrocnemius glycogen content was twofold higher in AICAR-treated rats than in controls. Chronic chemical activation of AMPK, therefore, results in increases in GLUT-4 protein, hexokinase activity, and glycogen, similarly to those induced by endurance training.},

abstract = {Tumour growth requires accompanying expansion of the host vasculature, with tumour progression often correlated with vascular density. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the best-characterized inducer of tumour angiogenesis. We report that VEGF dynamically regulates tumour endothelial expression of Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), which was previously shown to be absolutely required for normal embryonic vascular development. To define Dll4 function in tumour angiogenesis, we manipulated this pathway in murine tumour models using several approaches. Here we show that blockade resulted in markedly increased tumour vascularity, associated with enhanced angiogenic sprouting and branching. Paradoxically, this increased vascularity was non-productive-as shown by poor perfusion and increased hypoxia, and most importantly, by decreased tumour growth-even for tumours resistant to anti-VEGF therapy. Thus, VEGF-induced Dll4 acts as a negative regulator of tumour angiogenesis; its blockade results in a striking uncoupling of tumour growth from vessel density, presenting a novel therapeutic approach even for tumours resistant to anti-VEGF therapies.},

Indeed, abnormal and dysfunctional blood vessels in the tumor are incapable to restore oxygenation, therefore perpetuating hypoxia, which, in turn, will fuel tumor progression, metastasis and resistance to antitumor therapies. Nevertheless, how stromal components including blood and lymphatic endothelial cells, pericytes and fibroblasts, as well as hematopoietic cells, respond to low-oxygen tension in comparison with their normoxic counterparts has been a matter of investigation in the last few years only and, to date, this field of research remains poorly understood. In general, opposing phenotypes can arise from the same stromal component when embedded in different tumor microenvironments, and, vice versa, different stromal components can have opposite reaction to the same tumor microenvironment. In this article, we will discuss the emerging link between tumor stroma and hypoxia, and how this complexity is translated at the molecular level.},

Elevations in serum EPO level may be reflected in an augmentation in the red cell mass, thereby causing erythrocytosis. Studies on erythrocytosis have provided insights into the function of the oxygen-sensing pathway and the critical proteins involved in the regulation of EPO transcription. The $\alpha$ subunits of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor are hydroxylated by three prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes, which belong to the iron and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase superfamily. Sequence analysis of the genes encoding the PHDs in patients with erythrocytosis has revealed heterozygous germline mutations only occurring in Egl nine homolog 1 (EGLN1, also known as PHD2), the gene that encodes PHD2. To date, 24 different EGLN1 mutations comprising missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations have been described. The phenotypes associated with the patients carrying these mutations are fairly homogeneous and typically limited to erythrocytosis with normal to elevated EPO. However, exceptions exist; for example, there is one case with development of concurrent paraganglioma (PHD2-H374R). Analysis of the erythrocytosis-associated PHD2 missense mutations has shown heterogeneous results. Structural studies reveal that mutations can affect different domains of PHD2. Some are close to the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor $\alpha$/2-oxoglutarate or the iron binding sites for PHD2. In silico studies demonstrate that the mutations do not always affect fully conserved residues. In vitro and in cellulo studies showed varying effects of the mutations, ranging from mild effects to severe loss of function. The exact mechanism of a potential tumor-suppressor role for PHD2 still needs to be elucidated. A knockin mouse model expressing the first reported PHD2-P317R mutation recapitulates the phenotype observed in humans (erythrocytosis with inappropriately normal serum EPO levels) and demonstrates that haploinsufficiency and partial deregulation of PHD2 is sufficient to cause erythrocytosis.},

Here we report that Flt-1 is essential for the organization of embryonic vasculature, but is not essential for endothelial cell differentiation. Mouse embryos homozygous for a targeted mutation in the flt-1 locus, flt-1lcz, formed endothelial cells in both embryonic and extra-embryonic regions, but assembled these cells into abnormal vascular channels and died in utero at mid-somite stages. At earlier stages, the blood islands of flt-1lcz homozygotes were abnormal, with angioblasts in the interior as well as on the periphery. We suggest that the Flt-1 signalling pathway may regulate normal endothelial cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions during vascular development.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have identified many noncoding variants associated with common diseases and traits. We show that these variants are concentrated in regulatory DNA marked by deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) hypersensitive sites (DHSs). Eighty-eight percent of such DHSs are active during fetal development and are enriched in variants associated with gestational exposure-related phenotypes. We identified distant gene targets for hundreds of variant-containing DHSs that may explain phenotype associations. Disease-associated variants systematically perturb transcription factor recognition sequences, frequently alter allelic chromatin states, and form regulatory networks. We also demonstrated tissue-selective enrichment of more weakly disease-associated variants within DHSs and the de novo identification of pathogenic cell types for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and an electrocardiogram trait, without prior knowledge of physiological mechanisms. Our results suggest pervasive involvement of regulatory DNA variation in common human disease and provide pathogenic insights into diverse disorders.},

abstract = {The presence of hypoxia in tumor and its role in promoting angiogenesis are well-established. Recently, in addition to chronic hypoxia, cycling or intermittent hypoxia has also been demonstrated. However, its role in inducing new blood vessel formation is less clear. This work is aimed to investigate whether intermittent hypoxia can induce a pro-angiogenic phenotype in endothelial cells, in vitro. We studied changes in the expression of genes involved in inflammation and angiogenesis under intermittent and chronic hypoxia. We evidenced genes specifically expressed under intermittent hypoxia, suggesting different cell responses induced by intermittent versus chronic hypoxia. An increase in the expression of pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory genes under intermittent hypoxia, translating a pro-angiogenic effect of intermittent hypoxia was detected. In parallel, we investigated the activity of three transcription factors known to be activated either under hypoxia or by reoxygenation: HIF-1, Nrf2, and NF-{\$}\kappa{\$}B. HIF-1{\$}\alpha{\$} stabilization and an increase in HIF-1 transcriptional activity were evidenced under intermittent hypoxia. On the other hand, NRF2 and NF-{\$}\kappa{\$}B transcription factors were not activated. Finally, an increase in endothelial cell migration and in tubulogenesis in the course of hypoxia--reoxygenation cycles was evidenced, which was inhibited by HIF-1{\$}\alpha{\$} siRNA. All together, these results demonstrate a clear pro-angiogenic effect of intermittent hypoxia.},

By simply altering the sequence of the single-guide RNA (sgRNA), one can reprogram Cas9 to target different sites in the genome with relative ease, but the on-target activity and off-target effects of individual sgRNAs can vary widely. Here, we use recently devised sgRNA design rules to create human and mouse genome-wide libraries, perform positive and negative selection screens and observe that the use of these rules produced improved results. Additionally, we profile the off-target activity of thousands of sgRNAs and develop a metric to predict off-target sites. We incorporate these findings from large-scale, empirical data to improve our computational design rules and create optimized sgRNA libraries that maximize on-target activity and minimize off-target effects to enable more effective and efficient genetic screens and genome engineering.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) mediates many of the systemic and cellular responses to intermittent hypoxia (IH), which is an experimental model that simulates O2 saturation profiles occurring with recurrent apnea. IH-evoked HIF-1$\alpha$ synthesis and stability are due to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NADPH oxidases, especially Nox2. However, the mechanisms by which IH activates Nox2 are not known. We recently reported that IH activates xanthine oxidase (XO) and the resulting increase in ROS elevates intracellular calcium levels. Since Nox2 activation requires increased intracellular calcium levels, we hypothesized XO-mediated calcium signaling contributes to Nox activation by IH. We tested this possibility in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells subjected to IH consisting alternating cycles of hypoxia (1.5{\%} O2 for 30 sec) and normoxia (21{\%} O2 for 5 min). Kinetic analysis revealed that IH-induced XO preceded Nox activation. Inhibition of XO activity either by allopurinol or by siRNA prevented IH-induced Nox activation, translocation of the cytosolic subunits p47phox and p67phox to the plasma membrane and their interaction with gp91phox. ROS generated by XO also contribute to IH-evoked Nox activation via calcium-dependent protein kinase C stimulation. More importantly, silencing XO blocked IH-induced upregulation of HIF-1$\alpha$ demonstrating that HIF-1$\alpha$ activation by IH requires Nox2 activation by XO.},

Hypoxia is a physiological stress that induces a replication-associated DNA damage response. Moreover, hypoxia is the major driving force for neovascularization, as the hypoxia-mediated induction of vascular growth factors triggers endothelial cell proliferation. Here we studied the role of the hypoxia-induced DNA damage response in endothelial cell function and in hypoxia-driven neovascularization in vivo. Hypoxia induced replication-associated generation of gamma-H2AX in endothelial cells in vitro and in mice. Both in cultured cells and in mice, endothelial cell proliferation under hypoxic conditions was reduced by H2AX deficiency. Whereas developmental angiogenesis was not affected in H2afx(-/-) mice, hypoxia-induced neovascularization during pathologic proliferative retinopathy, in response to hind limb ischemia or during tumor angiogenesis was substantially lower in H2afx(-/-) mice. Moreover, endothelial-specific H2afx deletion resulted in reduced hypoxia-driven retina neovascularization and tumor neovascularization. Our findings establish that H2AX, and hence activation of the DNA repair response, is needed for endothelial cells to maintain their proliferation under hypoxic conditions and is crucial for hypoxia-driven neovascularization.},

abstract = {Neovascularization is a crucial component of tumor growth and ischemia. Although prior work primarily used disease models, delineation of neovascularization in the absence of disease can reveal intrinsic mechanisms of microvessel regulation amenable to manipulation in illness. We created a conditional model of epithelial HIF-1 induction in adult mice (TetON-HIF-1 mice). Longitudinal photoacoustic microscopy (L-PAM) was coincidentally developed for noninvasive, label-free serial imaging of red blood cell-perfused vasculature in the same mouse for weeks to months. TetON-HIF-1 mice evidenced 3 stages of neovascularization: development, maintenance, and transgene-dependent regression. Regression occurred despite extensive and tight pericyte coverage. L-PAM mapped microvascular architecture and quantified volumetric changes in neocapillary morphogenesis, arteriovenous remodeling, and microvessel regression. Developmental stage endothelial proliferation down-regulation was associated with a DNA damage checkpoint consisting of p53, p21, and endothelial gamma-H2AX induction. The neovasculature was temporally responsive to VEGFR2 immuno-blockade, with the developmental stage sensitive, and the maintenance stage resistant, to DC101 treatment. L-PAM analysis also pinpointed microvessels ablated or resistant to VEGFR2 immuno-blockade. HIF-1-recruited myeloid cells did not mediate VEGFR2 inhibitor resistance. Thus, HIF-1 neovascularization in the absence of disease is self-regulated via cell autonomous endothelial checkpoints, and resistant to angiogenesis inhibitors independent of myeloid cells.},

The effects of CIH were abolished by the antibody. Hypoxia-induced increases in plasma fasting triglycerides and adipose Angptl4 were not observed in mice with germline heterozygosity for a HIF-1$\alpha$ knockout allele. Transgenic overexpression of HIF-1$\alpha$ in adipose tissue led to dyslipidemia and increased levels of adipose Angptl4. In cultured adipocytes, constitutive expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ increased Angptl4 levels, which was abolished by siRNA. Finally, in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, the severity of nocturnal hypoxemia predicted Angptl4 levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: HIF-1-mediated increase in adipose Angptl4 and the ensuing lipoprotein lipase inactivation may contribute to atherosclerosis in patients with sleep apnea.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED For the analysis of microarray data, clustering techniques are frequently used. Most of such methods are based on hard clustering of data wherein one gene (or sample) is assigned to exactly one cluster. Hard clustering, however, suffers from several drawbacks such as sensitivity to noise and information loss. In contrast, soft clustering methods can assign a gene to several clusters. They can overcome shortcomings of conventional hard clustering techniques and offer further advantages. Thus, we constructed an R package termed Mfuzz implementing soft clustering tools for microarray data analysis. The additional package Mfuzzgui provides a convenient TclTk based graphical user interface. AVAILABILITY The R package Mfuzz and Mfuzzgui are available at http://itb1.biologie.hu-berlin.de/{\~{}}futschik/software/R/Mfuzz/index.html. Their distribution is subject to GPL version 2 license.},

abstract = {Chemical regulation of macrophage function is one key strategy for developing host-directed adjuvant therapies for tuberculosis (TB). A critical step to develop these therapies is the identification and characterization of specific macrophage molecules and pathways with a high potential to serve as drug targets. Using a barcoded lentivirus-based pooled short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) library combined with next generation sequencing, we identified 205 silenced host genes highly enriched in mycobacteria-resistant macrophages. Twenty-one of these " hits " belonged to the oxidoreductase functional category. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) was the top oxidoreductase " hit " . NQO1 expression was increased after mycobacterial infection, and NQO1 knockdown increased macrophage differentiation, NF-$\kappa$B activation, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$ in response to infection. This suggests that mycobacteria hijacks NQO1 to down-regulate pro-inflammatory and anti-bacterial functions. The competitive inhibitor of NQO1 dicoumarol synergized with rifampin to promote intracellular killing of mycobacteria. Thus, NQO1 is a new host target in mycobacterial infection that could potentially be exploited to increase antibiotic efficacy in vivo. Our findings also suggest that pooled shRNA libraries could be valuable tools for genome-wide screening in the search for novel druggable host targets for adjunctive TB therapies. Despite available treatments, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases 1 . One major factor fueling TB's re-emergence is the rise of antibiotic-resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 2,3 . Current TB drug regimes require combinations of multiple drugs that have to be taken for six months or longer 3–5 . Non-compliance with this lengthy treatment and poor access to TB drugs are key contributors to the emergence of multi-and extensively drug-resistant (MDR and XDR) M. tuberculosis strains 3,6 . Efforts to develop new anti-TB drugs have focused on targeting the bacillus. However, this approach has faced numerous obstacles and the cur-rent development pipeline for antibiotics against M. tuberculosis is limited 2 . A more promising approach may be the development of host-directed therapeutics (HDT) to supplement antibiotic therapy and shorten the course of treatment. Successful HDT may also improve the efficacy of second line therapy in drug-resistant TB and/or decrease lung pathology to preserve function 7 . The concept of drugs targeting host pathways to fight bacterial infection is relatively new and recent stud-ies support the feasibility of this strategy 8 . Intracellular M. tuberculosis growth was controlled by inhibitors of the PBK/AKT1 network 9 and by imatinib mesylate (STI-571, Gleevec), which inhibits ABL1, ABL2 and related tyrosine kinases 10 . Imatinib, a drug for chronic myelogenous leukemia, not only decreased M. tuberculosis growth in vitro but also reduced bacterial load and associated pathology in M. tuberculosis -infected mice. These findings demonstrate the potential of HDT to treat TB and provide a rationale for our efforts to obtain a precise and com-prehensive definition of the host molecules involved in M. tuberculosis infection. A key feature of M. tuberculosis pathogenesis is the ability of the bacteria to survive and replicate in host phagocytic cells 11–13 . Due to this central role in M. tuberculosis infection, macrophage function offers numerous targets for HDT. Although several crucial macrophage functions that control (autophagy, iNOS, ROS, cationic peptides) or promote (lipid bodies, iron acquisition) M. tuberculosis growth have been defined, many of the genes that regulate these functions remain unknown. As the first step in developing macrophage-based HDT, the iden-tification of the full range of host molecules that participate in M. tuberculosis' intracellular life cycle needs to be addressed. One approach to identify genes/proteins that play a role in specific biological process is through functional inhibition by RNA interference (RNAi). A handful of RNAi screenings aimed at identifying host factors that control mycobacterial entry and/or survival in macrophages have been reported 14–16},

abstract = {Pooled library sequencing screens that perturb gene function in a high-throughput manner are becoming increasingly popular in functional genomics research. Irrespective of the mechanism by which loss of function is achieved, via either RNA interference using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or genetic mutation using single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with the CRISPR-Cas9 system, there is a need to establish optimal analysis tools to handle such data. Our open-source processing pipeline in edgeR provides a complete analysis solution for screen data, that begins with the raw sequence reads and ends with a ranked list of candidate genes for downstream biological validation. We first summarize the raw data contained in a fastq file into a matrix of counts (samples in the columns, genes in the rows) with options for allowing mismatches and small shifts in sequence position. Diagnostic plots, normalization and differential representation analysis can then be performed using established methods to prioritize results in a statistically rigorous way, with the choice of either the classic exact testing methodology or generalized linear modeling that can handle complex experimental designs. A detailed users' guide that demonstrates how to analyze screen data in edgeR along with a point-and-click implementation of this workflow in Galaxy are also provided.

@article{Bajrami2014,
abstract = {Small-molecule inhibitors of PARP1/2, such as olaparib, have been proposed to serve as a synthetic lethal therapy for cancers that harbor BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Indeed, in clinical trials, PARP1/2 inhibitors elicit sustained antitumor responses in patients with germline BRCA gene mutations. In hypothesizing that additional genetic determinants might direct use of these drugs, we conducted a genome-wide synthetic lethal screen for candidate olaparib sensitivity genes. In support of this hypothesis, the set of identified genes included known determinants of olaparib sensitivity, such as BRCA1, RAD51, and Fanconi's anemia susceptibility genes. In addition, the set included genes implicated in established networks of DNA repair, DNA cohesion, and chromatin remodeling, none of which were known previously to confer sensitivity to PARP1/2 inhibition. Notably, integration of the list of candidate sensitivity genes with data from tumor DNA sequencing studies identified CDK12 deficiency as a clinically relevant biomarker of PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity. In models of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OVCa), CDK12 attenuation was sufficient to confer sensitivity to PARP1/2 inhibition, suppression of DNA repair via homologous recombination, and reduced expression of BRCA1. As one of only nine genes known to be significantly mutated in HGS-OVCa, CDK12 has properties that should confirm interest in its use as a biomarker, particularly in ongoing clinical trials of PARP1/2 inhibitors and other agents that trigger replication fork arrest.},

abstract = {Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is hallmarked by a high degree of heterogeneity. To address this heterogeneity, a classification scheme was developed based on gene expression patterns of 1538 tumours. Five, biologically distinct subgroups - Epi-A, Epi-B, Mes, Stem-A and Stem-B - exhibited significantly distinct clinicopathological characteristics, deregulated pathways and patient prognoses, and were validated using independent datasets. To identify subtype-specific molecular targets, ovarian cancer cell lines representing these molecular subtypes were screened against a genome-wide shRNA library. Focusing on the poor-prognosis Stem-A subtype, we found that two genes involved in tubulin processing, TUBGCP4 and NAT10, were essential for cell growth, an observation supported by a pathway analysis that also predicted involvement of microtubule-related processes. Furthermore, we observed that Stem-A cell lines were indeed more sensitive to inhibitors of tubulin polymerization, vincristine and vinorelbine, than the other subtypes. This subtyping offers new insights into the development of novel diagnostic and personalized treatment for EOC patients.},

abstract = {RNAi screening using pooled shRNA libraries is a valuable tool for identifying genetic regulators of biological processes. However, for a successful pooled shRNA screen, it is imperative to thoroughly optimize experimental conditions to obtain reproducible data. Here we performed viability screens with a library of ∼10,000 shRNAs at two different fold representations (100- and 500-fold at transduction) and report the reproducibility of shRNA abundance changes between screening replicates determined by microarray and next generation sequencing analyses. We show that the technical reproducibility between PCR replicates from a pooled screen can be drastically improved by ensuring that PCR amplification steps are kept within the exponential phase and by using an amount of genomic DNA input in the reaction that maintains the average template copies per shRNA used during library transduction. Using these optimized PCR conditions, we then show that higher reproducibility of biological replicates is obtained by both microarray and next generation sequencing when screening with higher average shRNA fold representation. shRNAs that change abundance reproducibly in biological replicates (primary hits) are identified from screens performed with both 100- and 500-fold shRNA representation, however a higher percentage of primary hit overlap between screening replicates is obtained from 500-fold shRNA representation screens. While strong hits with larger changes in relative abundance were generally identified in both screens, hits with smaller changes were identified only in the screens performed with the higher shRNA fold representation at transduction.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genomes contain a variety of structured patterns: repetitive elements, binding sites of DNA and RNA associated proteins, splice sites, and so on. Often, these structured patterns can be formalized as motifs and described using a proper mathematical model such as position weight matrix and IUPAC consensus. Two key tasks are typically carried out for motifs in the context of the analysis of genomic sequences. These are: identification in a set of DNA regions of over-represented motifs from a particular motif database, and de novo discovery of over-represented motifs. Here we describe existing methodology to perform these two tasks for motifs characterizing transcription factor binding. When applied to the output of ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo experiments, or to promoter regions of co-modulated genes, motif analysis techniques allow for the prediction of transcription factor binding events and enable identification of transcriptional regulators and co-regulators. The usefulness of motif analysis is further exemplified in this review by how motif discovery improves peak calling in ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo experiments and, when coupled with information on gene expression, allows insights into physical mechanisms of transcriptional modulation.},

abstract = {The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of cytokines regulates vascular development and inflammatory responses. We have recently shown that exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to hypoxia (1{\%} O(2)) increases gene expression and bioactivation of TGF-beta2 and induces its downstream effectors, Smad proteins (Smads), to associate with DNA. In the present study, we show that hypoxia-induced TGF-beta2 gene expression is dependent on thrombospondin-1-mediated bioactivation of latent TGF-beta. Blocking TGF-beta2 but not TGF-beta1 in hypoxic endothelial cell cultures inhibited induction of the TGF-beta2 gene, indicating that an autocrine mechanism driven by bioactivation of TGF-beta2 leads to its gene expression in hypoxic HUVECs. Exposure of HUVECs to hypoxia resulted in phosphorylation and nuclear transportation of Smad2 and Smad3 proteins as well as stimulation of transcriptional activities of Smad3 and the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and culminated in up-regulation of TGF-beta2 gene expression. Autocrine regulation of TGF-beta2 production in hypoxia may involve cross-talk between Smad3 and HIF-1alpha signaling pathways, and could be an important mechanism by which endothelial cells respond to hypoxic stress.},

abstract = {Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor (VHL) and unrestrained activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). Genetic and epigenetic determinants have an impact on HIF pathways. A recent genome-wide association study on renal cancer susceptibility identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an intergenic region located between the oncogenes MYC and PVT1. Here using assays of chromatin conformation, allele-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation and genome editing, we show that HIF binding to this regulatory element is necessary to trans-activate MYC and PVT1 expression specifically in cells of renal tubular origins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the risk-associated polymorphisms increase chromatin accessibility and activity as well as HIF binding to the enhancer. These findings provide further evidence that genetic variation at HIF-binding sites modulates the oncogenic transcriptional output of the VHL-HIF axis and provide a functional explanation for the disease-associated effects of SNPs in ccRCC.},

abstract = {To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional activation of fatty-acid synthase (FAS), we examined the relationship between upstream stimulatory factor (USF) and SREBP-1c, two transcription factors that we have shown previously to be critical for FAS induction by feeding/insulin. Here, by using a combination of tandem affinity purification and coimmunoprecipitation, we demonstrate, for the first time, that USF and SREBP-1 interact in vitro and in vivo. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments with various USF and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) deletion constructs indicate that the basic helix-loop-helix domain of USF interacts directly with the basic helix-loop-helix and an N-terminal region of SREBP-1c. Furthermore, cotransfection of USF and SREBP-1c with an FAS promoter-luciferase reporter construct in Drosophila SL2 cells results in highly synergistic activation of the FAS promoter. We also show similar cooperative activation of the mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase promoter by USF and SREBP-1c. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of mouse liver demonstrates that USF binds constitutively to the mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase promoter during fasting/refeeding in vivo, whereas binding of SREBP-1 is observed only during refeeding, in a manner identical to that of the FAS promoter. In addition, we show that the synergy we have observed depends on the activation domains of both proteins and that mutated USF or SREBP lacking the N-terminal activation domain could inhibit the transactivation of the other. Closely positioned E-boxes and sterol regulatory elements found in the promoters of several lipogenic genes suggest a common mechanism of induction by feeding/insulin.},

The elongation competence of RNA Polymerase II is regulated by the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb)-dependent phosphorylation of Ser2 residues on its C-terminal domain. Here, we report that hypoxia inhibits transcription at the level of elongation. The mechanism involves enhanced formation of inactive complex of P-TEFb with its inhibitor HEXIM1 in an HDAC3-dependent manner. Microarray transcriptome profiling of hypoxia primary response genes identified ∼79{\%} of these genes being HEXIM1-dependent. Hypoxic repression of P-TEFb was associated with reduced acetylation of its Cdk9 and Cyclin T1 subunits. Hypoxia caused nuclear translocation and co-localization of the Cdk9 and HDAC3/N-CoR repressor complex. We demonstrated that the described mechanism is involved in hypoxic repression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) gene. Thus, HEXIM1 and HDAC-dependent deacetylation of Cdk9 and Cyclin T1 in response to hypoxia signalling alters the P-TEFb functional equilibrium, resulting in repression of transcription.},

We have constructed an initial map of yeast's transcriptional regulatory code by identifying the sequence elements that are bound by regulators under various conditions and that are conserved among Saccharomyces species. The organization of regulatory elements in promoters and the environment-dependent use of these elements by regulators are discussed.

abstract = {The Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) aims to provide high-quality electronic and manual annotations to the UniProt Knowledgebase (Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and PIR-PSD) using the standardized vocabulary of the Gene Ontology (GO). As a supplementary archive of GO annotation, GOA promotes a high level of integration of the knowledge represented in UniProt with other databases. This is achieved by converting UniProt annotation into a recognized computational format. GOA provides annotated entries for nearly 60,000 species (GOA-SPTr) and is the largest and most comprehensive open-source contributor of annotations to the GO Consortium annotation effort. By integrating GO annotations from other model organism groups, GOA consolidates specialized knowledge and expertise to ensure the data remain a key reference for up-to-date biological information. Furthermore, the GOA database fully endorses the Human Proteomics Initiative by prioritizing the annotation of proteins likely to benefit human health and disease. In addition to a non-redundant set of annotations to the human proteome (GOA-Human) and monthly releases of its GO annotation for all species (GOA-SPTr), a series of GO mapping files and specific cross-references in other databases are also regularly distributed. GOA can be queried through a simple user-friendly web interface or downloaded in a parsable format via the EBI and GO FTP websites. The GOA data set can be used to enhance the annotation of particular model organism or gene expression data sets, although increasingly it has been used to evaluate GO predictions generated from text mining or protein interaction experiments. In 2004, the GOA team will build on its success and will continue to supplement the functional annotation of UniProt and work towards enhancing the ability of scientists to access all available biological information. Researchers wishing to query or contribute to the GOA project are encouraged to email: goa@ebi.ac.uk.},

abstract = {Dysregulation of the transcriptional repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST)/neuron-restrictive silencer factor is important in a broad range of diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. The role of REST-dependent epigenetic modifications in neurodegeneration is less clear. Here, we show that neuronal insults trigger activation of REST and CoREST in a clinically relevant model of ischemic stroke and that REST binds a subset of "transcriptionally responsive" genes (gria2, grin1, chrnb2, nefh, nf$\kappa$b2, trpv1, chrm4, and syt6), of which the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 is a top hit. Genes with enriched REST exhibited decreased mRNA and protein. We further show that REST assembles with CoREST, mSin3A, histone deacetylases 1 and 2, histone methyl-transferase G9a, and methyl CpG binding protein 2 at the promoters of target genes, where it orchestrates epigenetic remodeling and gene silencing. RNAi-mediated depletion of REST or administration of dominant-negative REST delivered directly into the hippocampus in vivo prevents epigenetic modifications, restores gene expression, and rescues hippocampal neurons. These findings document a causal role for REST-dependent epigenetic remodeling in the neurodegeneration associated with ischemic stroke and identify unique therapeutic targets for the amelioration of hippocampal injury and cognitive deficits.},

@article{Silverstein2005,
abstract = {SIN3 was first identified genetically as a global regulator of transcription. Sin3 is a large protein composed mainly of protein-interaction domains, whose function is to provide structural support for a heterogeneous Sin3/histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex. The core Sin3/HDAC complex is conserved from yeast to man and consists of eight proteins. In addition to HDACs, Sin3 can sequester other enzymatic functions, including nucleosome remodeling, DNA methylation, N-acetylglucoseamine transferase activity, and histone methylation. Since the Sin3/HDAC complex lacks any DNA-binding activity, it must be targeted to gene promoters by interacting with DNA-binding proteins. Although most research on Sin3 has focused on its role as a corepressor, mounting evidence suggests that Sin3 can also positively regulate transcription. Furthermore, Sin3 is key to the propagation of epigenetically silenced domains and is required for centromere function. Thus, Sin3 provides a platform to deliver multiple combinations modifications to the chromatin, using both sequence-specific and sequence-independent mechanisms.},

Discrete cohorts of genes can be either up- or down-regulated in response to hypoxia. While the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF) is the primary driver of hypoxia-induced adaptive gene expression, less is known about the signalling mechanisms regulating hypoxia-dependent gene repression. Using RNA-seq, we demonstrate that equivalent numbers of genes are induced and repressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. We demonstrate that nuclear localization of the Repressor Element 1-Silencing Transcription factor (REST) is induced in hypoxia and that REST is responsible for regulating approximately 20{\%} of the hypoxia-repressed genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays we demonstrate that REST-dependent gene repression is at least in part mediated by direct binding to the promoters of target genes. Based on these data, we propose that REST is a key mediator of gene repression in hypoxia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Hypoxia induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, EMT, to promote cancer metastasis. In addition to transcriptional regulation mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors, HIFs, other epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation, such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, are utilized under hypoxia. However, whether DNA demethylation mediated by TET1, a DNA dioxygenase converting 5-methylcytosine, 5mC, into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5hmC, plays a role in hypoxia-induced EMT is largely unknown. RESULTS We show that TET1 regulates hypoxia-responsive gene expression. Hypoxia/HIF-2$\alpha$ regulates the expression of TET1. Knockdown of TET1 mitigates hypoxia-induced EMT. RNA sequencing and 5hmC sequencing identified the set of TET1-regulated genes. Cholesterol metabolic process genes are among the genes that showed high prevalence and statistical significance. We characterize one of the genes, INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1), to confirm its expression and the 5hmC levels in its promoter. Knockdown of INSIG1 also mitigates hypoxia-induced EMT. Finally, TET1 is shown to be a transcriptional co-activator that interacts with HIF-1$\alpha$ and HIF-2$\alpha$ to enhance their transactivation activity independent of its enzymatic activity. TET1 acts as a co-activator to further enhance the expression of INSIG1 together with HIF-2$\alpha$. We define the domain in HIF-1$\alpha$ that interacts with TET1 and map the domain in TET1 that confers transactivation to a 200 amino acid region that contains a CXXC domain. The TET1 catalytically inactive mutant is capable of rescuing hypoxia-induced EMT in TET1 knockdown cells. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that TET1 serves as a transcription co-activator to regulate hypoxia-responsive gene expression and EMT, in addition to its role in demethylating 5mC.},

abstract = {The predominant function of the tumor suppressor p53 is transcriptional regulation. It is generally accepted that p53-dependent transcriptional activation occurs by binding to a specific recognition site in promoters of target genes. Additionally, several models for p53-dependent transcriptional repression have been postulated. Here, we evaluate these models based on a computational meta-analysis of genome-wide data. Surprisingly, several major models of p53-dependent gene regulation are implausible. Meta-analysis of large-scale data is unable to confirm reports on directly repressed p53 target genes and falsifies models of direct repression. This notion is supported by experimental re-analysis of representative genes reported as directly repressed by p53. Therefore, p53 is not a direct repressor of transcription, but solely activates its target genes. Moreover, models based on interference of p53 with activating transcription factors as well as models based on the function of ncRNAs are also not supported by the meta-analysis. As an alternative to models of direct repression, the meta-analysis leads to the conclusion that p53 represses transcription indirectly by activation of the p53-p21-DREAM/RB pathway.},

@article{Marlowe2004,
abstract = {The environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) causes a wide range of toxic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic effects. TCDD is a ligand for the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor believed to be the primary mediator of these effects. Activation of the AHR by TCDD also elicits a variety of effects on cell cycle progression, ranging from proliferation to arrest. In this report, we have characterized further the role of the activated AHR in cell cycle regulation. In human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 and mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 cells, TCDD treatment decreased the number of cells in S phase and caused the accumulation of cells in G(1). In Hepa-1 cells, this effect correlated with the transcriptional repression of several E2F-regulated genes required for S phase progression. AHR-mediated gene repression was dependent on its interaction with retinoblastoma protein but was independent of its transactivation function because AHR mutants lacking DNA binding or transactivation domains repressed E2F-dependent expression as effectively as wild type AHR. Overexpression of p300 suppressed retinoblastoma protein-dependent gene repression, and this effect was reversed by TCDD. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that TCDD treatment caused the recruitment of AHR to E2F-dependent promoters and the concurrent displacement of p300. These results delineate a novel mechanism whereby the AHR, a known transcriptional activator, also mediates gene repression by pathways involving combinatorial interactions at E2F-responsive promoters, leading to the repression of E2F-dependent, S phase-specific genes. The AHR seems to act as an environmental checkpoint that senses exposure to environmental toxicants and responds by signaling cell cycle inhibition.},

abstract = {The process of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is generally characterized by distinct morphological characteristics and energy-dependent biochemical mechanisms. Apoptosis is considered a vital component of various processes including normal cell turnover, proper development and functioning of the immune system, hormone-dependent atrophy, embryonic development and chemical-induced cell death. Inappropriate apoptosis (either too little or too much) is a factor in many human conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic damage, autoimmune disorders and many types of cancer. The ability to modulate the life or death of a cell is recognized for its immense therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on the elucidation and analysis of the cell cycle machinery and signaling pathways that control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To that end, the field of apoptosis research has been moving forward at an alarmingly rapid rate. Although many of the key apoptotic proteins have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of action or inaction of these proteins remain to be elucidated. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current knowledge on the process of apoptosis including morphology, biochemistry, the role of apoptosis in health and disease, detection methods, as well as a discussion of potential alternative forms of apoptosis.},

abstract = {It has been 50 years since cellular senescence was first described in human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs), yet its mechanism as well as its physiological and clinical implications are still not fully appreciated. Recent progress suggests that cellular senescence is a collective phenotype, composed of complex networks of effector programs. The balance and quality within the effector network varies depending on the cell type, the nature of the stress as well as the context. Therefore, understanding each of these effectors in the context of the whole network will be necessary in order to fully understand senescence as a whole. Furthermore, searching for new effector programs of senescence will help to define this heterogeneous and complex phenotype according to cellular contexts.},

@article{Elvidge2006,
abstract = {Studies of gene regulation by oxygen have revealed novel signal pathways that regulate the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcriptional system through post-translational hydroxylation of specific prolyl and asparaginyl residues in HIF-alpha subunits. These oxygen-sensitive modifications are catalyzed by members of the 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) dioxygenase family (PHD1, PHD2, PHD3, and FIH-1), raising an important question regarding the extent of involvement of these and other enzymes of the same family in directing the global changes in gene expression that are induced by hypoxia. To address this, we compared patterns of gene expression induced by hypoxia and by a nonspecific 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase inhibitor, dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), among a set of 22,000 transcripts, by microarray analysis of MCF7 cells. By using short interfering RNA-based suppression of HIF-alpha subunits, we also compared responses that were dependent on, or independent of, the HIF system. Results revealed striking concordance between patterns of gene expression induced by hypoxia and by DMOG, indicating the central involvement of 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases in oxygen-regulated gene expression. Many of these responses were suppressed by short interfering RNAs directed against HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, with HIF-1alpha suppression manifesting substantially greater effects than HIF-2alpha suppression, supporting the importance of HIF pathways. Nevertheless, the definition of genes regulated by both hypoxia and DMOG, but not HIF, distinguished other pathways most likely involving the action of 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases on non-HIF substrates.},

Applying this approach to the ENCODE dataset, we confirm already known and imply numerous novel transcription factors that play a role in the establishment or maintenance of open chromatin. In particular, our approach rediscovers many factors that have been annotated as pioneer factors.},

abstract = {Metabolomics is a new genomics approach that aims at measuring all or a subset of metabolites in the cell. Several approaches to plant metabolomics are currently used in plant research. These include targeted analysis, metabolite profiling, and metabolic fingerprinting. Metabolic fingerprinting, unlike metabolite profiling, does not aim at separating or identifying all the metabolites present in the sample, but rather generates a fingerprint that characterizes a specific metabolic state of the plant system under investigation. This chapter describes the implementation of metabolic fingerprinting approach using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and discriminant function analysis combined with genetic algorithm (GA-DFA). This approach enables the identification of specific metabolites that are biologically relevant, and which may go undetected if direct infusion-based fingerprinting approaches were used due to the sample complexity and matrix suppression effects.},

@article{Shen2005,
abstract = {The human hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 is a critical regulator of cellular and systemic responses to low oxygen levels. When oxygen levels are high, the HIF-1alpha subunit is hydroxylated and is targeted for degradation by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL). This regulatory pathway is evolutionarily conserved, and the Caenorhabditis elegans hif-1 and vhl-1 genes encode homologs of the HIF-1alpha subunit and VHL. To understand and describe more fully the molecular basis for hypoxia response in this important genetic model system, we compared hypoxia-induced changes in mRNA expression in wild-type, hif-1-deficient, and vhl-1-deficient C. elegans using whole genome microarrays. These studies identified 110 hypoxia-regulated gene expression changes, 63 of which require hif-1 function. Mutation of vhl-1 abrogates most hif-1-dependent changes in mRNA expression. Genes regulated by C. elegans hif-1 have predicted functions in signal transduction, metabolism, transport, and extracellular matrix remodeling. We examined the in vivo requirement for 16 HIF-1 target genes and discovered that the phy-2 prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha subunit is critical for survival in hypoxic conditions. Some HIF-1 target genes negatively regulate formation of stress-resistant dauer larvae. The microarray data presented herein also provide clear evidence for an HIF-1-independent pathway for hypoxia response, and this pathway regulates the expression of multiple heat shock proteins and several transcription factors.},

abstract = {Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are a family of transcription factors that regulate lipid homeostasis by controlling the expression of a range of enzymes required for endogenous cholesterol, fatty acid (FA), triacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis. The three SREBP isoforms, SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c and SREBP-2, have different roles in lipid synthesis. In vivo studies using transgenic and knockout mice suggest that SREBP-1c is involved in FA synthesis and insulin induced glucose metabolism (particularly in lipogenesis), whereas SREBP-2 is relatively specific to cholesterol synthesis. The SREBP-1a isoform seems to be implicated in both pathways. SREBP transcription factors are synthetized as inactive precursors bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. Upon activation, the precursor undergoes a sequential two-step cleavage process to release the NH 2-terminal active domain in the nucleus (designated nSREBPs). SREBP processing is mainly controlled by cellular sterol content. When sterol levels decrease, the precursor is cleaved to activate cholesterogenic genes and maintain cholesterol homeostasis. This sterol-sensitive process appears to be a major point of regulation for the SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 isoforms but not for SREBP-1c. Moreover, the SREBP-1c isoform seems to be mainly regulated at the transcriptional level by insulin. The unique regulation and activation properties of each SREBP isoform facilitate the co-ordinate regulation of lipid metabolism; however, further studies are needed to understand the detailed regulation pathways that specifically regulate each SREBP isoform. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier SAS.

abstract = {Cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in mammals are controlled by SREBPs, a family of membrane bound transcription factors. Our studies identified homologs of SREBP, its binding partner SCAP, and the ER retention protein Insig in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, named sre1+, scp1+, and ins1+. Like SREBP, Sre1 is cleaved and activated in response to sterol depletion in a Scp1-dependent manner. Microarray analysis revealed that Sre1 activates sterol biosynthetic enzymes as in mammals, and, surprisingly, Sre1 also stimulates transcription of genes required for adaptation to hypoxia. Furthermore, Sre1 rapidly activates these target genes in response to low oxygen and is itself required for anaerobic growth. Based on these findings, we propose and test a model in which Sre1 and Scp1 monitor oxygen-dependent sterol synthesis as an indirect measure of oxygen supply and mediate a hypoxic response in fission yeast.

An unexpected outcome of their work has been a new understanding of the structure and function of cell membranes. From the low-density lipoprotein receptor to sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) to SREBP cleavage-activating protein to Insig-1, each protein has provided a new and fundamentally novel insight into how membranes function as molecular sensors that respond to changes in the metabolic condition of the cell by moving molecules between cellular compartments.* This article is part of the Pioneers series in Trends in Cell Biology.

We report the cDNA cloning of human SREBP-1, a protein that binds SRE-1, activates transcription, and thereby mediate the final regulatory step in LDL metabolism. SREBP-1 contains a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) motif, but it differs from other bHLH-ZIP proteins in its larger size (1147 amino acids) and target sequence. Instead of an inverted repeat (CANNTG), the target for all known bHLH-ZIP proteins, SRE-1 contains a direct repeat of CAC. Overexpression of SREBP-1 activates transcription of reporter genes containing SRE-1 in the absence (15-fold) and presence (90-fold) of sterols, abolishing sterol regulation. We suggest that SREBP-1 is regulated by an unknown factor that is overwhelmed when SREBP-1 is overexpressed. Understanding the regulation of SREBP-1 may be crucial for understanding the control of plasma cholesterol in humans.},

abstract = {To systemically identify long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulating energy metabolism, we performed transcriptome analyses to simultaneously profile mRNAs and lncRNAs in key metabolic organs in mice under pathophysiologically representative metabolic conditions. Of 4,759 regulated lncRNAs, function-oriented filters yield 359 tissue-specifically regulated and metabolically sensitive lncRNAs that are predicted by lncRNA-mRNA correlation analyses to function in diverse aspects of energy metabolism. Specific regulations of liver metabolically sensitive lncRNAs (lncLMS) by nutrients, metabolic hormones, and key transcription factors were further defined in??primary hepatocytes. Combining genome-wide screens, bioinformatics function predictions, and cell-based analyses, we developed an integrative roadmap to identify lncRNA metabolic regulators. An lncLMS was experimentally confirmed in mice to suppress lipogenesis by forming a negative feedback loop in the SREBP1c pathway. Taken together, this study supports that a class of lncRNAs function as important metabolic regulators and establishes a framework for systemically investigating the role of lncRNAs in physiological homeostasis.},

This lifestyle often leads to energy imbalance, obesity, diabetes and their associated metabolic disorders, including cardiovascular diseases. It has become increasingly recognized that obesity and cardiovascular disease are metabolically linked, and a better understanding of this relationship requires that we uncover the fundamental genetic mechanisms controlling obesity-related heart dysfunction, a goal that has been difficult to achieve in higher organisms with intricate metabolic complexity. However, the high degree of evolutionary conservation of genes and signalling pathways allows researchers to use lower animal models such as Drosophila, which is the simplest genetic model with a heart, to uncover the mechanistic basis of obesity-related heart disease and its likely relevance to humans. Here, we discuss recent advances made by using the power of the Drosophila as a powerful model to investigate the genetic pathways by which a high fat diet may lead to heart dysfunction.},

abstract = {Over the last 70 years, prebiotic chemists have been very successful in synthesizing the molecules of life, from amino acids to nucleotides. Yet there is strikingly little resemblance between much of this chemistry and the metabolic pathways of cells, in terms of substrates, catalysts, and synthetic pathways. In contrast, alkaline hydrothermal vents offer conditions similar to those harnessed by modern autotrophs, but there has been limited experimental evidence that such conditions could drive prebiotic chemistry. In the Hadean, in the absence of oxygen, alkaline vents are proposed to have acted as electrochemical flow reactors, in which alkaline fluids saturated in H-2 mixed with relatively acidic ocean waters rich in CO2, through a labyrinth of interconnected micropores with thin inorganic walls containing catalytic Fe(Ni)S minerals. The difference in pH across these thin barriers produced natural proton gradients with equivalent magnitude and polarity to the proton-motive force required for carbon fixation in extant bacteria and archaea. How such gradients could have powered carbon reduction or energy flux before the advent of organic protocells with genes and proteins is unknown. Work over the last decade suggests several possible hypotheses that are currently being tested in laboratory experiments, field observations, and phylogenetic reconstructions of ancestral metabolism. We analyze the perplexing differences in carbon and energy metabolism in methanogenic archaea and acetogenic bacteria to propose a possible ancestral mechanism of CO2 reduction in alkaline hydrothermal vents. Based on this mechanism, we show that the evolution of active ion pumping could have driven the deep divergence of bacteria and archaea.

abstract = {Diseases and phenotypes caused by disrupted transcription factor (TF) binding are being identified, but progress is hampered by our limited capacity to predict such functional alterations. Improving predictions may be dependent on expanding the set of bona fide TF binding alterations. Allele-specific binding (ASB) events, where TFs preferentially bind to one of the two alleles at heterozygous sites, reveal the impact of sequence variations in altered TF binding. Here, we present the largest ASB compilation to our knowledge, 10 765 ASB events retrieved from 45 ENCODE ChIP-Seq data sets. Our analysis showed that ASB events were frequently associated with motif alterations of the ChIP'ed TF and potential partner TFs, allelic difference of DNase I hypersensitivity and allelic difference of histone modifications. For TF dimers bound symmetrically to DNA, ASB data revealed that central positions of the TF binding motifs were disproportionately important for binding. Lastly, the impact of variation on TF binding was predicted by a classification model incorporating all the investigated features of ASB events. Classification models using only DNase I hypersensitivity and sequence data exhibited predictive accuracy approaching the models with substantially more features. Taken together, the combination of ASB data and the classification model represents an important step toward elucidating regulatory variants across the human genome.},

Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and ∼1 h of hands-on time.},

abstract = {mRNA is the molecule that conveys genetic information from DNA to the translation apparatus. mRNAs in all organisms display a wide range of stability, and mechanisms have evolved to selectively and differentially regulate individual mRNA stability in response to intracellular and extracellular cues. In recent years, three seemingly distinct aspects of RNA biology-mRNA N 6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, alternative 3' end processing and polyadenylation (APA), and mRNA codon usage-have been linked to mRNA turnover, and all three aspects function to regulate global mRNA stability in cis. Here, we discuss the discovery and molecular dissection of these mechanisms in relation to how they impact the intrinsic decay rate of mRNA in eukaryotes, leading to transcriptome reprogramming. The number of protein-encoding genes has remained relatively constant during evolution, but mRNA isoforms, codon usage bias, and post-transcriptional modifications have increased substantially, resulting in changes of mRNA turnover across the transcriptome.The 3' UTRs of many protein-coding genes harbor multiple polyadenylation signals that are differentially selected based on the physiological state of cells, resulting in alternative mRNA isoforms with differing mRNA stability.m6A is the most abundant base modification in eukaryotic mRNA but many functional impacts of m6A on mRNA fate, mRNA stability in particular, have been discovered only recently.Codon usage in mRNA open-reading frames (ORFs) influences gene expression, with the proportion of optimal and nonoptimal codons helping to fine-tune mRNA stability in a process that is coupled to translation.},

abstract = {Cellular responses to oxygen are increasingly recognized as critical in normal development and physiology, and are implicated in pathological processes. Many of these responses are mediated by the transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2. Their regulation occurs through oxygen-dependent proteolysis of the alpha subunits HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, respectively. Both are stabilized in cell lines exposed to hypoxia, and recently HIF-1alpha was reported to be widely expressed in vivo. In contrast, regulation and sites of HIF-2alpha expression in vivo are unknown, although a specific role in endothelium was suggested. We therefore analyzed HIF-2alpha expression in control and hypoxic rats. Although HIF-2alpha was not detectable under baseline conditions, marked hypoxic induction occurred in all organs investigated, including brain, heart, lung, kidney, liver, pancreas, and intestine. Time course and amplitude of induction varied between organs. Immunohistochemistry revealed nuclear accumulation in distinct cell populations of each tissue, which were exclusively non-parenchymal in some organs (kidney, pancreas, and brain), predominantly parenchymal in others (liver and intestine) or equally distributed (myocardium). These data indicate that HIF-2 plays an important role in the transcriptional response to hypoxia in vivo, which is not confined to the vasculature and is complementary to rather than redundant with HIF-1.},

Here, we report the most comprehensive survey to date of chromatin organization in human tissues. Through integrative analysis of chromatin contact maps in 21 primary human tissues and cell types, we find topologically associating domains highly conserved in different tissues. We also discover genomic regions that exhibit unusually high levels of local chromatin interactions. These frequently interacting regions (FIREs) are enriched for super-enhancers and are near tissue-specifically expressed genes. They display strong tissue-specificity in local chromatin interactions. Additionally, FIRE formation is partially dependent on CTCF and the Cohesin complex. We further show that FIREs can help annotate the function of non-coding sequence variants.},

abstract = {The widespread adoption of short-read DNA sequencing as a digital epigenomic readout platform has motivated the development of genome-wide tools that achieve base-pair resolution. New methods for footprinting and affinity purification of nucleosomes, RNA polymerases, chromatin remodellers and transcription factors have increased the resolution of epigenomic profiling by two orders of magnitude, leading to new insights into how the chromatin landscape affects gene regulation. These digital epigenomic tools have also been applied to directly profile both turnover kinetics and transcription in situ. In this Review, we describe how these new genome-wide tools allow interrogation of diverse aspects of the epigenome.},

abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has rapidly become a popular tool to characterize transcriptomes. A fundamental research problem in many RNA-seq studies is the identification of reliable molecular markers that show differential expression between distinct sample groups. Together with the growing popularity of RNA-seq, a number of data analysis methods and pipelines have already been developed for this task. Currently, however, there is no clear consensus about the best practices yet, which makes the choice of an appropriate method a daunting task especially for a basic user without a strong statistical or computational background. To assist the choice, we perform here a systematic comparison of eight widely used software packages and pipelines for detecting differential expression between sample groups in a practical research setting and provide general guidelines for choosing a robust pipeline. In general, our results demonstrate how the data analysis tool utilized can markedly affect the outcome of the data analysis, highlighting the importance of this choice.},

abstract = {For many, if not most genes, the initiation of transcription is the principle point at which their expression is regulated. Transcription factors, some of which bind to specific DNA sequences, generally either activate or repress promoter activity and thereby control transcription initiation. Recent work has revealed in molecular detail some of the mechanisms used by transcription factors to bring about transcriptional repression. Some transcriptional repressor proteins counteract the activity of positively acting transcription factors. Other repressors inhibit the basal transcription machinery. In addition, the repression of transcription is often intimately associated with chromatin re-organisation. Many transcriptional repressor proteins interact either directly or indirectly with proteins that remodel chromatin or can themselves influence chromatin structure. This review discusses the mechanisms by which transcriptional repression is achieved and the role that chromatin re-organisation plays in this process.},

abstract = {The regulation of gene expression by transcriptional repression is an ancient and conserved mechanism that manifests itself in diverse ways. Here we summarize conserved pathways for transcriptional repression prevalent throughout all forms of life, as well as indirect mechanisms that appear to have originated in eukaryotes, consistent with the unique chromatin environment of eukaryotic genes. The direct interactions between transcriptional repressors and the core transcriptional machinery in bacteria and archaea are sufficient to generate a sophisticated suite of mechanisms that provide flexible control. These direct interactions contrast with the activity of corepressors, which provide an additional regulatory control in eukaryotes. Their modulation of chromatin structure represents an indirect pathway to downregulate transcription, and their diversity and modulation provide additional complexity suited to the requirements of elaborate eukaryotic repression patterns. New findings indicate that corepressors are not necessarily restricted to generating a single stereotypic output, but can rather exhibit diverse functional responses depending on the context in which they are recruited, providing a hitherto unsuspected additional source of diversity in transcriptional control. Mechanisms within eukaryotes appear to be highly conserved, with novel aspects chiefly represented by addition of lineage-specific corepressor scaffolds that provide additional opportunities for recruiting the same core machinery. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We used whole-genome design and complete chemical synthesis to minimize the 1079-kilobase pair synthetic genome of Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0. An initial design, based on collective knowledge of molecular biology combined with limited transposon mutagenesis data, failed to produce a viable cell. Improved transposon mutagenesis methods revealed a class of quasi-essential genes that are needed for robust growth, explaining the failure of our initial design. Three cycles of design, synthesis, and testing, with retention of quasi-essential genes, produced JCVI-syn3.0 (531 kilobase pairs, 473 genes), which has a genome smaller than that of any autonomously replicating cell found in nature. JCVI-syn3.0 retains almost all genes involved in the synthesis and processing of macromolecules. Unexpectedly, it also contains 149 genes with unknown biological functions. JCVI-syn3.0 is a versatile platform for investigating the core functions of life and for exploring whole-genome design.},

abstract = {The most detailed information presently available for an organism's transcriptional regulation network is that for the prokaryote Escherichia coli. In order to gain insight into the evolution of the E.coli regulatory network, we analysed information obtainable for the domains and protein families of the transcription factors and regulated genes. About three-quarters of the 271 transcription factors we identified are two-domain proteins, consisting of a DNA-binding domain along with a regulatory domain. The regulatory domains mainly bind small molecules. Many groups of transcription factors have identical domain architectures, and this implies that roughly three-quarters of the transcription factors have arisen as a consequence of gene duplication. In contrast, there is little evidence of duplication of regulatory regions together with regulated genes or of transcription factors together with regulated genes. Thirty-eight, out of the 121 transcription factors for which one or more regulated genes are known, regulate other transcription factors. This amplification effect, as well as large differences between the numbers of genes directly regulated by transcription factors, means that there are about 10 global regulators which each control many more genes than the other transcription factors.},

@article{Cheng2011,
abstract = {We present a network framework for analyzing multi-level regulation in higher eukaryotes based on systematic integration of various high-throughput datasets. The network, namely the integrated regulatory network, consists of three major types of regulation: TF→gene, TF→miRNA and miRNA→gene. We identified the target genes and target miRNAs for a set of TFs based on the ChIP-Seq binding profiles, the predicted targets of miRNAs using annotated 3'UTR sequences and conservation information. Making use of the system-wide RNA-Seq profiles, we classified transcription factors into positive and negative regulators and assigned a sign for each regulatory interaction. Other types of edges such as protein-protein interactions and potential intra-regulations between miRNAs based on the embedding of miRNAs in their host genes were further incorporated. We examined the topological structures of the network, including its hierarchical organization and motif enrichment. We found that transcription factors downstream of the hierarchy distinguish themselves by expressing more uniformly at various tissues, have more interacting partners, and are more likely to be essential. We found an over-representation of notable network motifs, including a FFL in which a miRNA cost-effectively shuts down a transcription factor and its target. We used data of C. elegans from the modENCODE project as a primary model to illustrate our framework, but further verified the results using other two data sets. As more and more genome-wide ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data becomes available in the near future, our methods of data integration have various potential applications.},

Cells use signaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms to coordinate multiple processes, allowing them to respond to and adapt to an ever-changing environment. The large number of components, the degree of interconnectivity and the complex control of cellular networks are becoming evident in the integrated genomic and proteomic analyses that are emerging. It is increasingly recognized that the understanding of properties that arise from whole-cell function require integrated, theoretical descriptions of the relationships between different cellular components. Recent theoretical advances allow us to describe cellular network structure with graph concepts and have revealed organizational features shared with numerous non-biological networks. We now have the opportunity to describe quantitatively a network of hundreds or thousands of interacting components. Moreover, the observed topologies of cellular networks give us clues about their evolution and how their organization influences their function and dynamic responses.},

We addressed this by developing an accurate and noninvasive method for measuring protein half-lives, called "bleach-chase," that is applicable to fluorescently tagged proteins. Assaying 100 proteins in living human cancer cells showed half-lives that ranged between 45 minutes and 22.5 hours. A variety of stresses that stop cell division showed the same general effect: Long-lived proteins became longer-lived, whereas short-lived proteins remained largely unaffected. This effect is due to the relative strengths of degradation and dilution and suggests a mechanism for differential killing of rapidly growing cells by growth-arresting drugs. This approach opens a way to understand proteome half-life dynamics in living cells.},

Recent advances in data collection and analysis, however, are generating unprecedented amounts of information about gene regulation networks. To understand these complex wiring diagrams, we sought to break down such networks into basic building blocks. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia coli. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable view of the entire known transcriptional network of the organism. This approach may help define the basic computational elements of other biological networks.},

In this review, we summarize and categorize the main frameworks and methods currently available for inferring transcriptional regulatory networks from microarray gene expression profiling data. We overview each of strategies and introduce representative methods respectively. Their assumptions, advantages, shortcomings, and possible improvements and extensions are also clarified and commented.},

abstract = {The majority of the human genome consists of non-coding regions that have been called junk DNA. However, recent studies have unveiled that these regions contain cis-regulatory elements, such as promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, etc. These regulatory elements can play crucial roles in controlling gene expressions in specific cell types, conditions, and developmental stages. Disruption to these regions could contribute to phenotype changes. Precisely identifying regulatory elements is key to deciphering the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation. Cis-regulatory events are complex processes that involve chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the interactions between them. The development of next-generation sequencing techniques has allowed us to capture these genomic features in depth. Applied analysis of genome sequences for clinical genetics has increased the urgency for detecting these regions. However, the complexity of cis-regulatory events and the deluge of sequencing data require accurate and efficient computational approaches, in particular, machine learning techniques. In this review, we describe machine learning approaches for predicting transcription factor binding sites, enhancers, and promoters, primarily driven by next-generation sequencing data. Data sources are provided in order to facilitate testing of novel methods. The purpose of this review is to attract computational experts and data scientists to advance this field.},

abstract = {Driven by technological progress, human life expectancy has increased greatly since the nineteenth century. Demographic evidence has revealed an ongoing reduction in old-age mortality and a rise of the maximum age at death, which may gradually extend human longevity 1,2 . Together with observations that lifespan in various animal species is flexible and can be increased by genetic or pharmaceutical intervention, these results have led to suggestions that longevity may not be subject to strict, species-specific genetic constraints. Here, by analysing global demographic data, we show that improvements in survival with age tend to decline after age 100, and that the age at death of the world's oldest person has not increased since the 1990s. Our results strongly suggest that the maximum lifespan of humans is fixed and subject to natural constraints. Maximum lifespan is, in contrast to average lifespan, generally assumed to be a stable characteristic of a species 3 . For humans, the maximum reported age at death is generally set at 122 years, the age at death of Jeanne Calment, still the oldest documented human individual who ever lived 4 . However, some evidence suggests that maximum lifespan is not fixed. Studies in model organisms have shown that maximum lifespan is flexible and can be affected by genetic and pharmacological interventions 5 . In Sweden, based on a long series of reliable information on the upper limits of human lifespan, the maximum reported age at death was found to have risen from about 101 years during the 1860s to about 108 years during the 1990s 6 . According to the authors, this finding refutes the common assertion that human lifespan is fixed and unchanging over time 6 . Indeed, the most convincing argument that the maximum lifespan of humans is not fixed is the ongoing increase in life expectancy in most countries over the course of the last century 1,2 . Figure 1a shows this increase for France, a country with high-quality mortality data, but very similar patterns were found for most other developed nations (Extended Data Fig. 1). Hence, the possibility has been considered that mortality may decline further, breaking any pre-conceived boundaries of human lifespan 1,7 . As shown by data from the Human Mortality Database 8 , many of the historical gains in life expectancy have been attributed to a reduction in early-life mortality. More recent data, however, show evidence for a decline in late-life mortality, with the fraction of each birth cohort reaching old age increasing with calendar year. In France, the number of individuals per 100,000 surviving to old age (70 and up) has increased since 1900 (Fig. 1b), which points towards a continuing increase in human life expectancy. This pattern is very similar across the other 40 countries and territories included in the database (Extended Data Figs 2, 3). However, the rate of improvement in survival peaks and then declines for very old age levels (Fig. 1c), which points},

abstract = {Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An over-dispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of over-dispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

abstract = {Adaptation to low oxygen conditions is essential for maintaining homeostasis and viability in oxygen-consuming multi-cellular tissues, including solid tumors. Central in these processes are the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, HIF-1 and HIF-2, controlling genes involved in e.g. glucose metabolism and neovascularization. Tumor hypoxia and HIF expression have also been associated with a dedifferentiated phenotype and increased aggressiveness. In this report we show that the MAX interactor-1 (MXI1) gene is directly regulated by HIF proteins in neuroblastoma and breast cancer cells. HIF-binding and transactivation were detected within MXI1 gene regulatory sequences in the vicinity of the MXI1-0 promoter, leading to rapid induction of the alternate MXI1-0 isoform followed by a long-term induction of both the MXI1-0 and MXI1 isoforms. Importantly, knock-down of MXI1 had limited effect on MYC/MYCN activity under hypoxia, an observation that might be related to the different functional attributes of the two MXI1 isoforms. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Decreased BRCA1 expression in the absence of genetic mutation is observed frequently in sporadic cancers of the breast and other sites, although little is known regarding the mechanisms by which the expression of this gene can be repressed. Here, we show that activating and repressive E2Fs simultaneously bind the BRCA1 promoter at two adjacent E2F sites in vivo, and that hypoxia induces a dynamic redistribution of promoter occupancy by these factors resulting in the transcriptional repression of BRCA1 expression. Functionally, we show that hypoxia is associated with impaired homologous recombination, whereas the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway is unaffected under these conditions. Repression of BRCA1 expression by hypoxia represents an intriguing mechanism of functional BRCA1 inactivation in the absence of genetic mutation. We propose that hypoxia-induced decreases in BRCA1 expression and consequent suppression of homologous recombination may lead to genetic instability by shifting the balance between the high-fidelity homologous recombination pathway and the error-prone NHEJ pathway of DNA repair. Furthermore, these findings provide a novel link between E2Fs and the transcriptional response to hypoxia and provide insight into the mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment can contribute to genetic instability in cancer.},

abstract = {The interaction of proteins with DNA recognition motifs regulates a number of fundamental biological processes, including transcription. To understand these processes, we need to know which motifs are present in a sequence and which factors bind to them. We describe a method to screen a set of DNA sequences against a precompiled library of motifs, and assess which, if any, of the motifs are statistically over- or under-represented in the sequences. Over-represented motifs are good candidates for playing a functional role in the sequences, while under-representation hints that if the motif were present, it would have a harmful dysregulatory effect. We apply our method (implemented as a computer program called Clover) to dopamine-responsive promoters, sequences flanking binding sites for the transcription factor LSF, sequences that direct transcription in muscle and liver, and Drosophila segmentation enhancers. In each case Clover successfully detects motifs known to function in the sequences, and intriguing and testable hypotheses are made concerning additional motifs. Clover compares favorably with an ab initio motif discovery algorithm based on sequence alignment, when the motif library includes only a homolog of the factor that actually regulates the sequences. It also demonstrates superior performance over two contingency table based over-representation methods. In conclusion, Clover has the potential to greatly accelerate characterization of signals that regulate transcription.},

abstract = {Retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor family pocket proteins induce cell cycle arrest by repressing transcription of E2F-regulated genes through both histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In this study we have identified a stable complex that accounts for the recruitment of both repression activities to the pocket. One component of this complex is RBP1, a known pocket-binding protein that exhibits both HDAC-dependent and -independent repression functions. RB family proteins were shown to associate via the pocket with previously identified mSIN3-SAP30-HDAC complexes containing exclusively class I HDACs. Such enzymes do not interact directly with RB family proteins but rather utilize RBP1 to target the pocket. This mechanism was shown to account for the majority of RB-associated HDAC activity. We also show that in quiescent normal human cells this entire RBP1-mSIN3-SAP30-HDAC complex colocalizes with both RB family members and E2F4 in a limited number of discrete regions of the nucleus that in other studies have been shown to represent the initial origins of DNA replication following growth stimulation. These results suggest that RB family members, at least in part, drive exit from the cell cycle by recruitment of this HDAC complex via RBP1 to repress transcription from E2F-dependent promoters and possibly to alter chromatin structure at DNA origins.},

abstract = {We and others have shown that the dysregulation of DNA repair pathways can contribute to the phenomenon of hypoxia-induced genetic instability within the tumor microenvironment. Several studies have revealed that the recombinational repair genes, RAD51 and BRCA1, and the DNA mismatch repair genes, MLH1 and MSH2, are decreased in expression in response to hypoxic stress, prompting interest in elucidating the mechanistic basis for these responses. Here we report that the downregulation of RAD51 by hypoxia is specifically mediated by repressive E2F4/p130 complexes that bind to a single E2F site in the proximal promoter of the gene. Intriguingly, this E2F site is conserved in the promoter of the BRCA1 gene, which is also regulated by a similar mechanism in hypoxia. Mechanistically, we have found that hypoxia induces substantial p130 dephosphorylation and nuclear accumulation, leading to the formation of E2F4/p130 complexes and increased occupancy of E2F4 and p130 at the RAD51 and BRCA1 promoters. These findings reveal a coordinated transcriptional program mediated by the formation of repressive E2F4/p130 complexes that represents an integral response to hypoxic stress. In addition, this co-regulation of key factors within the homology-dependent DNA repair pathway provides a further basis for understanding genetic instability in tumors and may guide the design of new therapeutic strategies for cancer.},

Mammals possess two highly related Sin3 proteins, mSin3A and mSin3B, which serve as scaffolds tethering HDAC enzymatic activity, and numerous sequence-specific transcription factors to enable local chromatin regulation at specific gene targets. Despite broad overlapping expression of mSin3A and mSin3B, mSin3A is cell-essential and vital for early embryonic development. Here, genetic disruption of mSin3B reveals a very different phenotype characterized by the survival of cultured cells and lethality at late stages of embryonic development with defective differentiation of multiple lineages-phenotypes that are strikingly reminiscent of those associated with loss of retinoblastoma family members or E2F transcriptional repressors. Additionally, we observe that, whereas mSin3B(-/-) cells cycle normally under standard growth conditions, they show an impaired ability to exit the cell cycle with limiting growth factors. Correspondingly, mSin3B interacts physically with the promoters of known E2F target genes, and its deficiency is associated with derepression of these gene targets in vivo. Together, these results reveal a critical role for mSin3B in the control of cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation in mammals and establish contrasting roles for the mSin3 proteins in the growth and development of specific lineages.},

abstract = {Mxi1 is a basic region helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH/LZ) protein that, in association with Max, antagonizes Myc oncogenic activities. A possible mechanistic basis for Mxi1-mediated repression was provided by the recent demonstration that the repressive potential of Mxi1 correlates with its ability to physically associate with mSin3B, one of two mammalian homologues of the yeast transcriptional repressor SIN3. Here, we sought to characterize more fully the physical properties of the second homologue, mSin3A and to determine whether the recruitment of mSin3A by Mxi1 is indeed required for anti-Myc activity. Transient transfection of mammalian cells showed that the mSin3A protein can associate with the strong repressive isoform of Mxi1 (Mxi1-SR) and that, like other Myc superfamily members, both mSin3A and Mxi1-SR localize to the nucleus. From a developmental standpoint, a comparative analysis of Myc, Mxi1-SR and Sin3A expression during postnatal mouse development and in differentiating mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells revealed that dramatic and reciprocal changes in Myc and Mxi1-SR mRNA levels are accompanied by minimal stage-specific changes in mSin3A gene expression. This constant expression profile, coupled with the observation that over-expression of mSin3A does not augment the anti-Myc activity of Mxi1-SR in the rat embryo fibroblast (REF) transformation assay, suggests that mSin3A is not a limiting factor in the regulation of Myc superfamily function. Finally, a mSin3A-Mxi1 fusion protein, in which the amino terminal mSin3-interacting domain of Mxi1-SR was replaced with the full-length mSin3A, exhibited a level of repression activity equivalent to, or greater than, the level of repression obtained with Mxi1-SR. Taken together, these observations directly demonstrate that the amino-terminal repression domain of Mxi1-SR functions solely to recruit mSin3A and possibly other proteins like mSin3A and this association is necessary for the anti-Myc activity of Mxi1-SR.},

Established methods for the analysis of gene annotations, particularly those based on the Gene Ontology, can identify functional linkages between genes. Similar methods for the identification of over-represented transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) have been successful in yeast, but extension to human genomics has largely proved ineffective. Creation of a system for the efficient identification of common regulatory mechanisms in a subset of co-expressed human genes promises to break a roadblock in functional genomics research. We have developed an integrated system that searches for evidence of co-regulation by one or more transcription factors (TFs). oPOSSUM combines a pre-computed database of conserved TFBSs in human and mouse promoters with statistical methods for identification of sites over-represented in a set of co-expressed genes. The algorithm successfully identified mediating TFs in control sets of tissue-specific genes and in sets of co-expressed genes from three transcript profiling studies. Simulation studies indicate that oPOSSUM produces few false positives using empirically defined thresholds and can tolerate up to 50{\%} noise in a set of co-expressed genes.},

abstract = {DEC1/STRA13 is a bHLH type transcriptional regulator involved with immune regulation, hypoxia response and carcinogenesis. We recently demonstrated that STRA13 interacts with STAT3 in the transcriptional activation of STAT-dependent promoters. Here, we pursue STRA13 involvement in the JAK/STAT pathway by studying its role in STAT1 expression. First, we showed that VHL deficiency or HIF-1 activation resulted in the repression of endogenous STAT1 mediated by STRA13. We then characterized the STAT1 proximal promoter to assess its response to STRA13 by transient coexpression in a luciferase reporter assay. Using sequential truncation and site-directed mutagenesis of the STAT1 promoter with STRA13 deletion constructs, we showed that the STRA13 C-terminal trans-activation domain, which is known to bind HDAC1, mostly determines the repressive activity. Involvement of HDAC activity in STAT1 regulation was validated by TSA inhibition and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Thus, we demonstrate that STRA13-mediated repression of STAT1 transcription utilizes an HDAC1-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, we show that targets of unphosphorylated STAT1, such as antigen presenting genes and CASP1, are also repressed by hypoxia possibly through the same STRA13-mediated mechanism. Thus, the newly discovered link between HIF-1 and STAT1 reveals a previously unknown role of STRA13 in hypoxia and carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {MicroRNA (miRNA) expression alterations have been described in cancer. Many cancers are characterized by areas of hypoxia, enhanced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) levels, and increased expression of hypoxically regulated genes, all of which correlate with patient outcome. We examined hypoxia-induced miRNA expression changes to identify markers of survival in breast cancer. We used microarrays to analyze miRNA expression changes induced by hypoxia in MCF7 breast cancer cell lines and validated results by quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR). Small interfering RNA against and , and RCC4 cells transfected with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein were used to investigate HIF dependency of miRNA expression. miRNA Q-PCR assays were done on 219 early breast cancer samples with long-term follow-up. Correlation of expression with clinical variables was done using Pearson and Spearman's rank tests, univariate, and Cox multivariate analysis. hsa-miR-210 induction was the most significant change under hypoxia by microarray analysis (3.4-fold, {\textless} 0.001). hsa-miR-210 expression changes were validated by Q-PCR and detected in other cancer cell lines. Using small interfering RNAs and RCC4 cells transfected with VHL, we showed that the regulation by hypoxia of hsa-miR-210 was mediated by the HIF-1$\alpha$/VHL transcriptional system but not HIF-2$\alpha$. hsa-miR-210 expression levels in breast cancer samples correlated directly with a hypoxia score based on the expression of 99 genes. hsa-miR-210 expression levels showed an inverse correlation with disease-free and overall survival, significant in both univariate and multivariate analyses. We show that hsa-miR-210 overexpression is induced by hypoxia in a HIF-1$\alpha$– and VHL-dependent fashion and its expression levels in breast cancer samples are an independent prognostic factor.},

abstract = {Hypoxia results in adaptive changes in the transcription of a range of genes including erythropoietin. An important mediator is hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a DNA binding complex shown to contain at least two basic helix-loop-helix PAS-domain (bHLH-PAS) proteins, HIF-1alpha and aryl hydrocarbon nuclear receptor translocator (ARNT). In response to hypoxia, HIF-1alpha is activated and accumulates rapidly in the cell. Endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS-1) is a recently identified bHLH-PAS protein with 48{\%} identity to HIF-1alpha, raising the question of its role in responses to hypoxia. We developed specific antibodies and studied expression and regulation of EPAS-1 mRNA and protein across a range of human cell lines. EPAS-1 was widely expressed, and strongly induced by hypoxia at the level of protein but not mRNA. Comparison of the effect of a range of activating and inhibitory stimuli showed striking similarities in the EPAS-1 and HIF-1alpha responses. Although major differences were observed in the abundance of EPAS-1 and HIF-1alpha in different cell types, differences in the inducible response were subtle with EPAS-1 protein being slightly more evident in normoxic and mildly hypoxic cells. Functional studies in a mutant cell line (Ka13) expressing neither HIF-1alpha nor EPAS-1 confirmed that both proteins interact with hypoxically responsive targets, but suggest target specificity with greater EPAS-1 transactivation (relative to HIF-1alpha transactivation) of the VEGF promoter than the LDH-A promoter.},

abstract = {We have isolated and characterized a cDNA for a novel Per-Arnt/AhR-Sim basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH-PAS) factor that interacts with the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt), and its predicted amino acid sequence exhibits significant similarity to the hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) and Drosophila trachealess (dTrh) gene product. The HIF1alpha-like factor (HLF) encoded by the isolated cDNA bound the hypoxia-response element (HRE) found in enhancers of genes for erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and various glycolytic enzymes, and activated transcription of a reporter gene harboring the HRE. Although transcription-activating properties of HLF were very similar to those reported for HIF1alpha, their expression patterns were quite different between the two factors; HLF mRNA was most abundantly expressed in lung, followed by heart, liver, and other various organs under normoxic conditions, whereas HIF1alpha mRNA was ubiquitously expressed at much lower levels. In lung development around parturition, HLF mRNA expression was markedly enhanced, whereas that of HIF1alpha mRNA remained apparently unchanged at a much lower level. Moreover, HLF mRNA expression was closely correlated with that of VEGF mRNA. Whole mount in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that HLF mRNA was expressed in vascular endothelial cells at the middle stages (9.5 and 10.5 days postcoitus) of mouse embryo development, where HIF1alpha mRNA was almost undetectable. The high expression level of HLF mRNA in the O2 delivery system of developing embryos and adult organs suggests that in a normoxic state, HLF regulates gene expression of VEGF, various glycolytic enzymes, and others driven by the HRE sequence, and may be involved in development of blood vessels and the tubular system of lung.},

abstract = {In an effort to better understand the mechanism of toxicity of 2,3,7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, we employed an iterative search of human expressed sequence tags to identify novel basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) proteins that interact with either the Ah receptor (AHR) or the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). We characterized five new "members of the PAS superfamily," or MOPs 1-5, that are similar in size and structural organization to the AHR and ARNT. MOPs 1-4 have N-terminal bHLH and PAS domains and C-terminal variable regions. MOP5 contained the characteristic PAS domain and a variable C terminus; it is possible that the cDNA contains a bHLH domain, but the entire open reading frame has yet to be completed. Coimmunoprecipitation studies, yeast two-hybrid analysis, and transient transfection experiments demonstrated that MOP1 and MOP2 dimerize with ARNT and that these complexes are transcriptionally active at defined DNA enhancer sequences in vivo. MOP3 was found to associate with the AHR in vitro but not in vivo. This observation, coupled with the fact that MOP3 formed tighter associations with the 90-kDa heat shock protein than the human AHR, suggests that MOP3 may be a conditionally active bHLH-PAS protein that requires activation by an unknown ligand. The expression profiles of the AHR, MOP1, and MOP2 mRNAs, coupled with the observation that they all share ARNT as a common dimeric partner, suggests that the cellular pathways mediated by MOP1 and MOP2 may influence or respond to the dioxin signaling pathway.},

abstract = {Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a PAS domain transcription factor termed endothelial PAS-1 (EPAS1). This protein shares 48{\%} sequence identity with hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1alpha) and lesser similarity with other members of the basic helix-loop-helix/PAS domain family of transcription factors. Like HIF-1alpha, EPAS1 binds to and activates transcription from a DNA element originally isolated from the erythropoietin gene and containing the sequence 5'-GCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3'. Activation by both HIF-1alpha and EPAS1 is stimulated by hypoxic conditions. EPAS1 forms a heterodimeric complex with the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear transporter prior to transcriptional activation of target genes. EPAS1 expression is limited to the endothelium of mouse embryos and, in agreement with its cell type-specific expression pattern, is capable of specifically activating the transcription of the endothelial tyrosine kinase gene Tie-2. These observations raise the possibility that EPAS1 may represent an important regulator of vascularization, perhaps involving the regulation of endothelial cell gene expression in response to hypoxia.},

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activates transcription of genes encoding proteins that mediate adaptive responses to hypoxia, including erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and glycolytic enzymes. Expression of the HIF-1alpha subunit increases exponentially as O2 concentration is decreased. Hif1a-/- mouse embryos with complete deficiency of HIF-1alpha due to homozygosity for a null allele at the Hif1a locus die at midgestation, with multiple cardiovascular malformations and mesenchymal cell death. Hif1a+/- heterozygotes develop normally and are indistinguishable from Hif1a+/+ wild-type littermates when maintained under normoxic conditions. In this study, the physiological responses of Hif1a+/- and Hif1a+/+ mice exposed to 10{\%} O2 for one to six weeks were analyzed. Hif1a+/- mice demonstrated significantly delayed development of polycythemia, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary vascular remodeling and significantly greater weight loss compared with wild-type littermates. These results indicate that partial HIF-1alpha deficiency has significant effects on multiple systemic responses to chronic hypoxia.},

The alpha subunit of HIF is targeted for degradation under normoxic conditions by a ubiquitin-ligase complex that recognizes a hydroxylated proline residue in HIF. We identified a conserved family of HIF prolyl hydoxylase (HPH) enzymes that appear to be responsible for this posttranslational modification. In cultured mammalian cells, inappropriate accumulation of HIF caused by forced expression of the HIF-1alpha subunit under normoxic conditions was attenuated by coexpression of HPH. Suppression of HPH in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells by RNA interference resulted in elevated expression of a hypoxia-inducible gene (LDH, encoding lactate dehydrogenase) under normoxic conditions. These findings indicate that HPH is an essential component of the pathway through which cells sense oxygen.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Logos are commonly used in molecular biology to provide a compact graphical representation of the conservation pattern of a set of sequences. They render the information contained in sequence alignments or profile hidden Markov models by drawing a stack of letters for each position, where the height of the stack corresponds to the conservation at that position, and the height of each letter within a stack depends on the frequency of that letter at that position. RESULTS: We present a new tool and web server, called Skylign, which provides a unified framework for creating logos for both sequence alignments and profile hidden Markov models. In addition to static image files, Skylign creates a novel interactive logo plot for inclusion in web pages. These interactive logos enable scrolling, zooming, and inspection of underlying values. Skylign can avoid sampling bias in sequence alignments by down-weighting redundant sequences and by combining observed counts with informed priors. It also simplifies the representation of gap parameters, and can optionally scale letter heights based on alternate calculations of the conservation of a position. CONCLUSION: Skylign is available as a website, a scriptable web service with a RESTful interface, and as a software package for download. Skylign's interactive logos are easily incorporated into a web page with just a few lines of HTML markup. Skylign may be found at http://skylign.org.},

abstract = {Understanding the complex mechanisms governing basic biological processes requires the characterisation of regulatory motifs modulating gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In particular, extent, chronology and cell-specificity of transcription are modulated by the interaction of transcription factors with their corresponding binding sites, mostly located near (or sometimes quite far away from) the transcription start site of the gene. The constantly growing amount of genomic data, complemented by other sources of information such as expression data derived from microarray experiments, has opened new opportunities to researchers in this field. Many different methods have been proposed for the identification of transcription factor binding sites in the regulatory regions of co-expressed genes: unfortunately this is a very challenging problem both from the computational and the biological viewpoint. This paper provides a survey of existing methods proposed for the problem, focusing both on the ideas underlying them and their availability to the scientific community.},

Typically, conventional statistical methods are used for the development of outcome prediction models and risk scores. However, these analyses carry inherent properties limiting their ability to cope with large data sets with multiple variables and samples. Machine learning (ML), a field stemming from artificial intelligence, is part of a wider approach for data analysis termed data mining (DM). It enables prediction in complex data scenarios, familiar to practitioners and researchers. Technological and commercial applications are all around us, gradually entering clinical research. In the following review, we would like to expose hematologists and stem cell transplanters to the concepts, clinical applications, strengths and limitations of such methods and discuss current research in HSCT. The aim of this review is to encourage utilization of the ML and DM techniques in the field of HSCT, including prediction of transplantation outcome and donor selection.},

abstract = {Although the proteins that read the gene regulatory code, transcription factors (TFs), have been largely identified, it is not well known which sequences TFs can recognize. We have analyzed the sequence-specific binding of human TFs using high-throughput SELEX and ChIP sequencing. A total of 830 binding profiles were obtained, describing 239 distinctly different binding specificities. The models represent the majority of human TFs, approximately doubling the coverage compared to existing systematic studies. Our results reveal additional specificity determinants for a large number of factors for which a partial specificity was known, including a commonly observed A- or T-rich stretch that flanks the core motifs. Global analysis of the data revealed that homodimer orientation and spacing preferences, and base-stacking interactions, have a larger role in TF-DNA binding than previously appreciated. We further describe a binding model incorporating these features that is required to understand binding of TFs to DNA. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Many approaches have been developed to model and learn a protein's DNA-binding specificity, but these methods have not been systematically compared. Here we applied 26 such approaches to in vitro protein binding microarray data for 66 mouse TFs belonging to various families. For nine TFs, we also scored the resulting motif models on in vivo data, and found that the best in vitro-derived motifs performed similarly to motifs derived from the in vivo data. Our results indicate that simple models based on mononucleotide position weight matrices trained by the best methods perform similarly to more complex models for most TFs examined, but fall short in specific cases ({\textless}10{\%} of the TFs examined here). In addition, the best-performing motifs typically have relatively low information content, consistent with widespread degeneracy in eukaryotic TF sequence preferences.},

abstract = {Background: Massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments are gradually superseding microarrays in quantitative gene expression profiling. However, many biologists are uncertain about the choice of differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis methods and the validity of cost-saving sample pooling strategies for their RNA-seq experiments. Hence, we performed experimental validation of DEGs identified by Cuffdiff2, edgeR, DESeq2 and Two-stage Poisson Model (TSPM) in a RNA-seq experiment involving mice amygdalae micro-punches, using high-throughput qPCR on independent biological replicate samples. Moreover, we sequenced RNA-pools and compared their results with sequencing corresponding individual RNA samples. Results: False-positivity rate of Cuffdiff2 and false-negativity rates of DESeq2 and TSPM were high. Among the four investigated DEG analysis methods, sensitivity and specificity of edgeR was relatively high. We documented the pooling bias and that the DEGs identified in pooled samples suffered low positive predictive values. Conclusions: Our results highlighted the need for combined use of more sensitive DEG analysis methods and high-throughput validation of identified DEGs in future RNA-seq experiments. They indicated limited utility of sample pooling strategies for RNA-seq in similar setups and supported increasing the number of biological replicate samples.},

abstract = {AIMS This study aimed to determine the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Spain and identify the level of undiagnosed disease and its impact on health-related quality of life (HRQL) and activities of daily living (ADL). METHODS A population-based sample of 4274 adults aged 40-80 years was surveyed. They were invited to answer a questionnaire and undergo prebrochodilator and postbronchodilator spirometry. COPD was defined as a postbronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity) ratio of {\textless}0.70. RESULTS For 3802 participants with good-quality postbronchodilator spirometry, the overall prevalence of COPD was 10.2{\{}{\%}{\}} (95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI 9.2{\{}{\%}{\}} to 11.1{\{}{\%}{\}}) and was higher in men (15.1{\{}{\%}{\}}) than in women (5.6{\{}{\%}{\}}). The prevalence of COPD stage II or higher was 4.4{\{}{\%}{\}} (95{\{}{\%}{\}}CI; 3.8{\{}{\%}{\}}-5.1{\{}{\%}{\}}). The prevalence of COPD increased with age and with cigarette smoking and was higher in those with a low educational level. A previous diagnosis of COPD was reported by only 27{\{}{\%}{\}} of those with COPD. Diagnosed patients had more severe disease, higher cumulative tobacco consumption and more severely impaired HRQL compared with undiagnosed subjects. However, even patients with undiagnosed COPD stage I+ already showed impairment in HRQL and in some aspects of ADL compared with participants without COPD. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of COPD in individuals between 40 and 80 years of age in Spain is 10.2{\{}{\%}{\}} and increases with age, tobacco consumption and lower educational levels. The rate of diagnosised COPD is very high and undiagnosed individuals with COPD already have a significant impairment in HRQL and ADL.},

EglN2 is estrogen inducible in breast carcinoma cells and the lone Drosophila EglN interacts genetically with Cyclin D1. Although EglN2 is a nonessential gene, we found that EglN2 inactivation decreases Cyclin D1 levels and suppresses mammary gland proliferation in vivo. Regulation of Cyclin D1 is a specific attribute of EglN2 among the EglN proteins and is HIF independent. Loss of EglN2 catalytic activity inhibits estrogen-dependent breast cancer tumorigenesis and can be rescued by exogenous Cyclin D1. EglN2 depletion also impairs the fitness of lung, brain, and hematopoietic cancer lines. These findings support the exploration of EglN2 inhibitors as therapeutics for estrogen-dependent breast cancer and other malignancies.},

@article{Furlow2009,
abstract = {A classic physiologic response to hypoxia in humans is the up-regulation of the ERYTHROPOIETIN (EPO) gene, which is the central regulator of red blood cell mass. The EPO gene, in turn, is activated by hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). HIF is a transcription factor consisting of an alpha subunit (HIF-alpha) and a beta subunit (HIF-beta). Under normoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylase domain protein (PHD, also known as HIF prolyl hydroxylase and egg laying-defective nine protein) site specifically hydroxylates HIF-alpha in a conserved LXXLAP motif (where underlining indicates the hydroxylacceptor proline). This provides a recognition motif for the von Hippel Lindau protein, a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets hydroxylated HIF-alpha for degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, this inherently oxygen-dependent modification is arrested, thereby stabilizing HIF-alpha and allowing it to activate the EPO gene. We previously identified and characterized an erythrocytosis-associated HIF2A mutation, G537W. More recently, we reported two additional erythrocytosis-associated HIF2A mutations, G537R and M535V. Here, we describe the functional characterization of these two mutants as well as a third novel erythrocytosis-associated mutation, P534L. These mutations affect residues C-terminal to the LXXLAP motif. We find that all result in impaired degradation and thus aberrant stabilization of HIF-2alpha. However, each exhibits a distinct profile with respect to their effects on PHD2 binding and von Hippel Lindau interaction. These findings reinforce the importance of HIF-2alpha in human EPO regulation, demonstrate heterogeneity of functional defects arising from these mutations, and point to a critical role for residues C-terminal to the LXXLAP motif in HIF-alpha.},

Our systematic review of research articles published in top physiology journals (n = 703) suggests that, as scientists, we urgently need to change our practices for presenting continuous data in small sample size studies. Papers rarely included scatterplots, box plots, and histograms that allow readers to critically evaluate continuous data. Most papers presented continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies. Investigators can quickly make univariate scatterplots for small sample size studies using our Excel templates.},

abstract = {Regulatory factor binding to genomic DNA protects the underlying sequence from cleavage by DNase I, leaving nucleotide-resolution footprints. Using genomic DNase I footprinting across 41 diverse cell and tissue types, we detected 45 million transcription factor occupancy events within regulatory regions, representing differential binding to 8.4 million distinct short sequence elements. Here we show that this small genomic sequence compartment, roughly twice the size of the exome, encodes an expansive repertoire of conserved recognition sequences for DNA-binding proteins that nearly doubles the size of the human cis-regulatory lexicon. We find that genetic variants affecting allelic chromatin states are concentrated in footprints, and that these elements are preferentially sheltered from DNA methylation. High-resolution DNase I cleavage patterns mirror nucleotide-level evolutionary conservation and track the crystallographic topography of protein-DNA interfaces, indicating that transcription factor structure has been evolutionarily imprinted on the human genome sequence. We identify a stereotyped 50-base-pair footprint that precisely defines the site of transcript origination within thousands of human promoters. Finally, we describe a large collection of novel regulatory factor recognition motifs that are highly conserved in both sequence and function, and exhibit cell-selective occupancy patterns that closely parallel major regulators of development, differentiation and pluripotency.},

Adipocyte differentiation is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, indicating that oxygen (O(2)) is an important physiological regulator of adipogenesis. Hypoxia inhibits PPAR gamma 2 nuclear hormone receptor transcription, and overexpression of PPAR gamma 2 or C/EBP beta stimulates adipogenesis under hypoxia. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) are refractory to hypoxia-mediated inhibition of adipogenesis. The HIF-1-regulated gene DEC1/Stra13, a member of the Drosophila hairy/Enhancer of split transcription repressor family, represses PPAR gamma 2 promoter activation and functions as an effector of hypoxia-mediated inhibition of adipogenesis. These data indicate that an O(2)-sensitive signaling mechanism regulates adipogenesis. Thus, agents that regulate HIF-1 activity or O(2) sensing may be used to inhibit adipogenesis and control obesity.},

@article{Mangan2003,
abstract = {Engineered systems are often built of recurring circuit modules that carry out key functions. Transcription networks that regulate the responses of living cells were recently found to obey similar principles: they contain several biochemical wiring patterns, termed network motifs, which recur throughout the network. One of these motifs is the feed-forward loop (FFL). The FFL, a three-gene pattern, is composed of two input transcription factors, one of which regulates the other, both jointly regulating a target gene. The FFL has eight possible structural types, because each of the three interactions in the FFL can be activating or repressing. Here, we theoretically analyze the functions of these eight structural types. We find that four of the FFL types, termed incoherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive accelerators: they speed up the response time of the target gene expression following stimulus steps in one direction (e.g., off to on) but not in the other direction (on to off). The other four types, coherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive delays. We find that some FFL types appear in transcription network databases much more frequently than others. In some cases, the rare FFL types have reduced functionality (responding to only one of their two input stimuli), which may partially explain why they are selected against. Additional features, such as pulse generation and cooperativity, are discussed. This study defines the function of one of the most significant recurring circuit elements in transcription networks.},

The VHL gene product, pVHL, is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the alpha subunits of the heterodimeric transcription factor HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) for degradation in the presence of oxygen. Here we report that a HIF2alpha variant lacking both of its two prolyl hydroxylation/pVHL-binding sites prevents tumor inhibition by pVHL in a DNA-binding dependent manner. Conversely, downregulation of HIF2alpha with short hairpin RNAs is sufficient to suppress tumor formation by pVHL-defective renal carcinoma cells. These results establish that tumor suppression by pVHL is linked to regulation of HIF target genes.},

abstract = {The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a widely utilized genetic model, is highly resistant to oxygen starvation and is beginning to be used for studying physiological, developmental, and cellular adaptations to hypoxia. The Drosophila respiratory (tracheal) system has features in common with the mammalian circulatory system so that an angiogenesis-like response occurs upon exposure of Drosophila larvae to hypoxia. A hypoxia-responsive system homologous to mammalian hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) has been described in the fruit fly, where Fatiga is a Drosophila oxygen-dependent HIF prolyl hydroxylase, and the basic helix-loop-helix Per/ARNT/Sim (bHLH-PAS) proteins Sima and Tango are, respectively, the Drosophila homologues of mammalian HIF-alpha ({\$}\alpha{\$}) and HIF-beta ({\$}\beta{\$}). Tango is constitutively expressed regardless of oxygen tension and, like in mammalian cells, Sima is controlled at the level of protein degradation and subcellular localization. Sima is critically required for development in hypoxia, but, unlike mammalian model systems, it is dispensable for development in normoxia. In contrast, fatiga mutant alleles are all lethal; however, strikingly, viability to adulthood is restored in fatiga sima double mutants, although these double mutants are not entirely normal, suggesting that Fatiga has Sima-independent functions in fly development. Studies in cell culture and in vivo have revealed that Sima is activated by the insulin receptor (InR) and target-of-rapamycin (TOR) pathways. Paradoxically, Sima is a negative regulator of growth. This suggests that Sima is engaged in a negative feedback loop that limits growth upon stimulation of InR/TOR pathways. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein-coding RNAs that function as negative gene expression regulators. In the present study, we investigated miRNAs role in endothelial cell response to hypoxia. We found that the expression of miR-210 progressively increased upon exposure to hypoxia. miR-210 overexpression in normoxic endothelial cells stimulated the formation of capillary-like structures on Matrigel and vascular endothelial growth factor-driven cell migration. Conversely, miR-210 blockade via anti-miRNA transfection inhibited the formation of capillary-like structures stimulated by hypoxia and decreased cell migration in response to vascular endothelial growth factor. miR-210 overexpression did not affect endothelial cell growth in both normoxia and hypoxia. However, anti-miR-210 transfection inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis, in both normoxia and hypoxia. We determined that one relevant target of miR-210 in hypoxia was Ephrin-A3 since miR-210 was necessary and sufficient to down-modulate its expression. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays showed that Ephrin-A3 was a direct target of miR-210. Ephrin-A3 modulation by miR-210 had significant functional consequences; indeed, the expression of an Ephrin-A3 allele that is not targeted by miR-210 prevented miR-210-mediated stimulation of both tubulogenesis and chemotaxis. We conclude that miR-210 up-regulation is a crucial element of endothelial cell response to hypoxia, affecting cell survival, migration, and differentiation.},

abstract = {HIF plays a central role in the transcriptional response to changes in oxygen availability. The PHD family of oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylases plays a pivotal role in regulating HIF stability. The biochemical properties of these enzymes make them well suited to act as oxygen sensors. They also respond to other intracellular signals, including reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and certain metabolites, that can modulate the hypoxic response. HIF transcriptional activity is further tuned by FIH1-mediated asparagine hydroxylation. HIF affects signaling pathways that influence development, metabolism, inflammation, and integrative physiology. Accordingly, HIF-modulatory drugs are now being developed for diverse diseases.},

Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent.

Likewise, disruption of the TSC1/TSC2 complex through loss of TSC1 or TSC2 has been shown to result in abnormal accumulation of HIF-1alpha. Here, we investigate the novel polymorphisms in exon 12, that approximate the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1alpha in five cell lines and 28 patients with oral squamous carcinomas. Moreover, we assess for the presence of polymorphisms and mutations in TSC1 and TSC2, to ascertain if dysregulation of such might complement HIF-1alpha expression.},

abstract = {Resistance to Imatinib Mesylate (IM) is a major problem in Chronic Myelogenous Leukaemia management. Most of the studies about resistance have focused on point mutations on BCR/ABL. However, other types of resistance that do not imply mutations in BCR/ABL have been also described. In the present report we aim to study the role of several MAPK in IM resistance not associate to BCR/ABL mutations. Therefore we used an experimental system of resistant cell lines generated by co-culturing with IM (K562, Lama 84) as well as primary material from resistant and responder patient without BCR/ABL mutations. Here we demonstrate that Erk5 and p38MAPK signaling pathways are not implicated in the acquired resistance phenotype. However, Erk2, but not Erk1, is critical for the acquired resistance to IM. In fact, Bcr/Abl activates preferentially Erk2 in transient transfection in a dose dependent fashion through the c-Abl part of the chimeric protein. Finally, we present evidences demonstrating how constitutive activation of Erk2 is a de novo mechanism of resistance to IM. In summary our data support the use of therapeutic approaches based on Erk2 inhibition, which could be added to the therapeutic armamentarium to fight CML, especially when IM resistance develops secondary to Erk2 activation.},

These properties are treated as random fields, which renders nonlinear advection-reaction transport equations stochastic. We derive a deterministic equation for the probability density function (PDF) of the concentration of a solute that undergoes heterogeneous reactions, e.g., precipitation or dissolution. The derivation treats exactly (without linearization) a reactive term in the transport equation which accounts for uncertainty (randomness) in both flow velocity and kinetic rate constants but requires a closure, such as a Large-Eddy-Diffusivity (LED) approximation used in the present analysis. No closure is required when reaction rates are the only source of uncertainty. We use exact concentration PDFs obtained for this setting to analyze the accuracy of our general, LED-based PDF equations.},

abstract = {The surface of nucleosomes is studded with a multiplicity of modifications. At least eight different classes have been characterized to date and many different sites have been identified for each class. Operationally, modifications function either by disrupting chromatin contacts or by affecting the recruitment of nonhistone proteins to chromatin. Their presence on histones can dictate the higher-order chromatin structure in which DNA is packaged and can orchestrate the ordered recruitment of enzyme complexes to manipulate DNA. In this way, histone modifications have the potential to influence many fundamental biological processes, some of which may be epigenetically inherited.},

@article{Salceda1997a,
abstract = {The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 transcriptional activator complex (HIF-1) is involved in the activation of the erythropoietin and several other hypoxia-responsive genes. The HIF-1 complex is composed of two protein subunits: HIF-1beta/ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator), which is constitutively expressed, and HIF-1alpha, which is not present in normal cells but induced under hypoxic conditions. The HIF-1alpha subunit is continuously synthesized and degraded under normoxic conditions, while it accumulates rapidly following exposure to low oxygen tensions. The involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the proteolytic destruction of HIF-1 in normoxia was studied by the use of specific inhibitors of the proteasome system. Lactacystin and MG-132 were found to protect the degradation of the HIF-1 complex in cells transferred from hypoxia to normoxia. The same inhibitors were able to induce HIF-1 complex formation when added to normoxic cells. Final confirmation of the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the regulated degradation of HIF-1alpha was obtained by the use of ts20TGR cells, which contain a temperature-sensitive mutant of E1, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Exposure of ts20 cells, under normoxic conditions, to the non-permissive temperature induced a rapid and progressive accumulation of HIF-1. The effect of proteasome inhibitors on the normoxic induction of HIF-1 binding activity was mimicked by the thiol reducing agent N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine and by the oxygen radical scavenger 2-acetamidoacrylic acid. Furthermore, N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine induced gene expression as measured by the stimulation of a HIF-1-luciferase expression vector and by the induction of erythropoietin mRNA in normoxic Hep 3B cells. These last findings strongly suggest that the hypoxia induced changes in HIF-1alpha stability and subsequent gene activation are mediated by redox-induced changes.},

In this concise textbook, the authors' fresh pedagogical approaches lead biology students from first principles towards computational thinking. A team of renowned bioinformaticians take innovative routes to introduce computational ideas in the context of real biological problems. Intuitive explanations promote deep understanding, using little mathematical formalism. Self-contained chapters show how computational procedures are developed and applied to central topics in bioinformatics and genomics, such as the genetic basis of disease, genome evolution or the tree of life concept. Using bioinformatic resources requires a basic understanding of what bioinformatics is and what it can do. Rather than just presenting tools, the authors - each a leading scientist - engage the students' problem-solving skills, preparing them to meet the computational challenges of their life science careers.},

@article{Metzen2007a,
abstract = {The transcriptional activator HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) is a focal point of biomedical research because many situations in physiology and in pathology coincide with hypoxia. The effects of HIF activation may be a facet of normal growth, as in embryonic development, they may counterbalance a disease, as seen in the stimulation of erythropoiesis in anaemia, and they may be part of the pathological processes, as exemplified by tumour angiogenesis. The oxygen-sensitive alpha-subunits of HIF are primarily regulated by the enzymatic hydroxylation that induces rapid proteasomal degradation. The HIFalpha hydroxylases belong to a superfamily of dioxygenases that require the co-substrates oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate as well as the cofactors Fe2+ and ascorbate. The regulation of enzyme turnover by the concentration of the cosubstrate oxygen constitutes the interface between tissue oxygen level and the activity of HIF. The HIFalpha prolyl hydroxylases, termed PHDs/EGLNs (prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins/EGL nine homologues), bind to a conserved Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-Ala-Pro motif present in all substrates identified so far. This recognition motif is present twice in HIF1alpha, which gives rise to a NODD [N-terminal ODD (oxygen-dependent degradation domain)] containing Pro402 of HIF1alpha and a CODD (C-terminal ODD) where Pro564 is hydroxylated. PHD1/EGLN2 and PHD2/EGLN1 hydroxylate both ODDs with higher activity towards CODD, whereas PHD3/EGLN3 is specific for CODD. The reason for this behaviour has been unclear. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Villar and colleagues demonstrate that distinct PHD/EGLN domains, that are remote from the catalytic site, function in substrate discrimination. This elegant study improves our understanding of the interaction of the oxygen-sensing PHDs/EGLNs with their substrates, which include, but are not limited to, the HIFalpha proteins.},

The VHL gene product, pVHL, is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the alpha subunits of the heterodimeric transcription factor HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) for degradation in the presence of oxygen. Here we report that a HIF2alpha variant lacking both of its two prolyl hydroxylation/pVHL-binding sites prevents tumor inhibition by pVHL in a DNA-binding dependent manner. Conversely, downregulation of HIF2alpha with short hairpin RNAs is sufficient to suppress tumor formation by pVHL-defective renal carcinoma cells. These results establish that tumor suppression by pVHL is linked to regulation of HIF target genes.},

The experiment seems to be a scientific breakthrough of paramount importance--until Algernon begins his sudden, unexpected deterioration. Will the same happen to Charlie? An American classic that inspired the award-winning movie Charly.},

Here we use whole-genome resequencing of six 293 cell lines to study the dynamics of this aneuploid genome in response to the manipulations used to generate common 293 cell derivatives, such as transformation and stable clone generation (293T); suspension growth adaptation (293S); and cytotoxic lectin selection (293SG). Remarkably, we observe that copy number alteration detection could identify the genomic region that enabled cell survival under selective conditions (i.c. ricin selection). Furthermore, we present methods to detect human/vector genome breakpoints and a user-friendly visualization tool for the 293 genome data. We also establish that the genome structure composition is in steady state for most of these cell lines when standard cell culturing conditions are used. This resource enables novel and more informed studies with 293 cells, and we will distribute the sequenced cell lines to this effect.},

abstract = {We have characterized the cytogenetic alterations of the human embryonal cell line 293 by spectral karyotyping and G-banding analysis. To investigate its genomic stability, we compared the karyotypes of 293 and its daughter line EcR-293. Genotype profiling through short tandem repeats complemented the analysis. While displaying almost identical STR profiles and thus verifying their origin and their close relation, the two lines were remarkably different in their number of chromosomes and setup of aberrant chromosomes. However, the cell lines retained a stable karyotype in long term culture. The establishment of subclones from EcR-293, expressing inducible lacZ or MEN1 transgenes, only added minor changes to the karyotype. Our study shows that the cytogenetic constitution of a clonal cell line of the 293 origin appears to be sufficiently stable. However, care should be taken when comparing the properties of independent 293 lineages, since clonal variations might be substantial.},

We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes.

Simulations have traditionally been used in population genetics by a fairly small community with programming expertise, but the recent availability of dozens of sophisticated, customizable software packages for simulation now makes simulation an accessible option for researchers in many fields. The in silico genetic data produced by simulations, along with greater availability of population-genomics data, are transforming genetic epidemiology, anthropology, evolutionary and population genetics and conservation. In this Review of the state-of-the-art of simulation software, we identify applications of simulations, evaluate simulator capabilities, provide a guide for their use and summarize future directions.},

Such tools are needed at each step of a systems biology computational workflow, which typically consists of data handling, network inference, deep curation, dynamical simulation and model analysis. In addition, there are now efforts to develop integrated software platforms, so that tools that are used at different stages of the workflow and by different researchers can easily be used together. This Review describes the types of software tools that are required at different stages of systems biology research and the current options that are available for systems biology researchers. We also discuss the challenges and prospects for modelling the effects of genetic changes on physiology and the concept of an integrated platform.},

Short-read massively parallel sequencing has revolutionized our ability to discover genetic variation but is insufficient to generate high-quality genome assemblies or resolve most structural variation. Full resolution of variation is only guaranteed by complete de novo assembly of a genome. Here, we review approaches to genome assembly, the nature of gaps or missing sequences, and biases in the assembly process. We describe the challenges of generating a complete de novo genome assembly using current technologies and the impact that being able to perfectly sequence the genome would have on understanding human disease and evolution. Finally, we summarize recent technological advances that improve both contiguity and accuracy and emphasize the importance of complete de novo assembly as opposed to read mapping as the primary means to understanding the full range of human genetic variation.},

abstract = {High altitude sickness (HAS) occurs among humans visiting or inhabiting high altitude environments. Genetic differences in the EPAS1 and EGLN1 genes have been found between lowland (Han) and highland (Tibetan) Chinese. Three SNPs within EPAS1 and EGLN1 were evaluated in Han and Tibetan patients with acute mountain sickness (AMS) and chronic mountain sickness (CMS). We compared 85 patients with AMS to 79 Han unaffected with mountain sickness (MS) as well as 45 CMS patients to 34 unaffected Tibetan subjects. The three SNPs studied were EPAS1 [ch2: 46441523 (hg18], EGLN1 (rs480902) and (rs516651). Direct sequencing was used to identify individual genotypes for the three SNPs. Age was found to be significantly associated with the EPAS1 SNP in the CMS patients while heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation level of hemoglobin (SaO2) were found to be significantly associated with the EGLN1 (rs480902) SNP in the Han patients with AMS. The individuals with CMS were found to diverge significantly for the EPAS1 SNP compared to their Tibetan control group as measured by genetic distance (0.123) indicating positive selection of the EPAS-G allele with age and illness. The EGLN1 (rs480902) SNP had a significant correlation with hematocrit (HCT), HR and SaO2 in AMS patients. AMS and CMS were found to be significantly associated with the EPAS1 and EGLN1 SNPs compared to their Han and Tibetan control groups, respectively, indicating these nucleotide alterations have a physiological effect for the development of high altitude sickness. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Mucus hypersecretion from hyperplastic airway goblet cells is a hallmark of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although cigarette smoking is thought to be involved in mucus hypersecretion in COPD, the mechanism by which cigarette smoke induces mucus overproduction is unknown. Here we show that activation of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) is responsible for mucin production after inhalation of cigarette smoke in airways in vitro and in vivo. In the airway epithelial cell line NCI-H292, exposure to cigarette smoke upregulated the EGFR mRNA expression and induced activation of EGFR-specific tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in upregulation of MUC5AC mRNA and protein production, effects that were inhibited completely by selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BIBX1522, AG-1478) and that were decreased by antioxidants. In vivo, cigarette smoke inhalation increased MUC5AC mRNA and goblet cell production in rat airways, effects that were prevented by pretreatment with BIBX1522. These effects may explain the goblet cell hyperplasia that occurs in COPD and may provide a novel strategy for therapy in airway hypersecretory diseases.},

abstract = {The epithelial cells lining the airways serve protective functions. The "barrier function" of the epithelium protects the individual from damage by inhaled irritants. The epithelium produces mucins which become hydrated and form a viscoelastic gel which spreads over the epithelial surface. In healthy individuals inhaled foreign materials become entrapped in the mucus and are cleared by mucociliary transport and by coughing. In many chronic inflammatory airway diseases, however, excessive mucus is produced and is inadequately cleared, leading to mucous obstruction and infection. At present there is no specific treatment for hypersecretion. However, the discovery that an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cascade is involved in mucin production by a wide variety of stimuli suggests that blockade may provide specific treatment for hypersecretory diseases. EGFR pathways have also been implicated in the repair of damaged airway epithelium. The roles of EGFR in airway epithelial cell hypersecretion and epithelial damage and repair are reviewed and future potential treatments are suggested.},

abstract = {Sleep-disordered breathing with recurrent apnea (periodic cessation of breathing) results in chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), which leads to cardiovascular and respiratory pathology. Molecular mechanisms underlying IH-evoked cardio-respiratory co-morbidities have not been delineated. Mice with heterozygous deficiency of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) do not develop cardio-respiratory responses to chronic IH. HIF-1alpha protein expression and HIF-1 transcriptional activity are induced by IH in PC12 cells. In the present study, we investigated the signaling pathways associated with IH-evoked HIF-1alpha accumulation. PC12 cells were exposed to aerobic conditions (20{\%} O(2)) or 60 cycles of IH (30 sec at 1.5{\%} O(2) followed by 5 min at 20{\%} O(2)). Our results show that IH-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation is due to increased generation of ROS by NADPH oxidase. We further demonstrate that ROS-dependent Ca(2+) signaling pathways involving phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) and protein kinase C activation are required for IH-evoked HIF-1alpha accumulation. IH leads to activation of mTOR and S6 kinase (S6K) and rapamycin partially inhibited IH-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation. IH also decreased hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha protein and anti-oxidants as well as inhibitors of Ca(+2) signaling prevented this response. Thus, both increased mTOR-dependent HIF-1alpha synthesis and decreased hydroxylase-dependent HIF-1alpha degradation contribute to IH-evoked HIF-1alpha accumulation. Following IH, HIF-1alpha, and phosphorylated mTOR levels remained elevated during 90 min of re-oxygenation despite re-activation of prolyl hydroxylase. Rapamycin or cycloheximide, blocked increased HIF-1alpha levels during re-oxygenation indicating that mTOR-dependent protein synthesis is required for the persistent elevation of HIF-1alpha levels during re-oxygenation.},

abstract = {The VHL gene product (pVHL) forms a multimeric complex with the elongin B and C, Cul2 and Rbx1 proteins (VCBCR complex), which is homologous to the SCF family of ubiquitin ligase complexes. The VCBCR complex binds HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, transcription factors critically involved in cellular responses to hypoxia, and targets them for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Germline mutations in the VHL gene cause susceptibility to haemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), phaeochromocytoma and other tumours. In addition somatic inactivation of the VHL gene occurs in most sporadic clear cell RCC (CC-RCC). However, the absence of somatic VHL inactivation in 30-40{\%} of CC-RCC implies the involvement of other gatekeeper genes in CC-RCC development. We reasoned that in CC-RCC without VHL inactivation, other pVHL-interacting proteins might be defective. To assess the role of elongin B/C, Rbx1 and HIF-1alpha in RCC tumorigenesis we (a) mapped the genes to chromosomes 8q(cen) (elongin C), 16p13.3 (elongin B) and 22q11.2 (Rbx1) by FISH, monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel screening and in silico GenBank homology searching; (b) determined the genomic organisation of elongin C (by direct sequencing of PAC clones), Rbx1 and elongin B (by GenBank homology searching); and (c) performed mutation analysis of exons comprising the coding regions of elongins B, C and Rbx1 and the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1alpha by SSCP screening and direct sequencing in 35 sporadic clear cell RCC samples without VHL gene inactivation and in 13 individuals with familial non-VHL clear cell RCC. No coding region sequence variations were detected for the elongin B, elongin C or Rbx1 genes. Two amino acid substitutions (Pro582Ser and Ala588Thr) were identified in the oxygen-dependent degradation/pVHL binding domain of HIF-1alpha, however neither substitution was observed exclusively in tumour samples. Association analysis in panels of CC-RCC and non-neoplastic samples using the RFLPs generated by each variant did not reveal allelic frequency differences between RCC patients and controls (P{\textgreater}0.32 by chi-squared analysis). Nevertheless, the significance of these variations and their potential for modulation of HIF-1alpha function merits further investigation in both other tumour types and in non-neoplastic disease. Taken together with our previous Cul2 mutation analysis these data suggest that development of sporadic and familial RCC is not commonly contributed to by genetic events altering the destruction domain of HIF-1alpha, or components of the HIF-alpha destruction complex other than VHL itself. Although (a) activation of HIF could occur through mutation of another region of HIF-a, and (b) epigenetic silencing of elongin B/C, Cul2 or Rbx1 cannot be excluded, these findings suggest that pVHL may represent the sole mutational target through which the VCBR complex is disrupted in CC-RCC. HIF response is activated in CC-RCC tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {AIMS This study aimed to determine the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Spain and identify the level of undiagnosed disease and its impact on health-related quality of life (HRQL) and activities of daily living (ADL). METHODS A population-based sample of 4274 adults aged 40-80 years was surveyed. They were invited to answer a questionnaire and undergo prebrochodilator and postbronchodilator spirometry. COPD was defined as a postbronchodilator FEV(1)/FVC (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity) ratio of {\textless}0.70. RESULTS For 3802 participants with good-quality postbronchodilator spirometry, the overall prevalence of COPD was 10.2{\%} (95{\%} CI 9.2{\%} to 11.1{\%}) and was higher in men (15.1{\%}) than in women (5.6{\%}). The prevalence of COPD stage II or higher was 4.4{\%} (95{\%}CI; 3.8{\%}-5.1{\%}). The prevalence of COPD increased with age and with cigarette smoking and was higher in those with a low educational level. A previous diagnosis of COPD was reported by only 27{\%} of those with COPD. Diagnosed patients had more severe disease, higher cumulative tobacco consumption and more severely impaired HRQL compared with undiagnosed subjects. However, even patients with undiagnosed COPD stage I+ already showed impairment in HRQL and in some aspects of ADL compared with participants without COPD. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of COPD in individuals between 40 and 80 years of age in Spain is 10.2{\%} and increases with age, tobacco consumption and lower educational levels. The rate of diagnosised COPD is very high and undiagnosed individuals with COPD already have a significant impairment in HRQL and ADL.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED We have investigated genetic/pathogenetic factors associated with a new clinical entity in patients presenting with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PHEO/PGL) and polycythemia. Two patients without hypoxia-inducible factor 2$\alpha$ (HIF2A) mutations, who presented with similar clinical manifestations, were analyzed for other gene mutations, including prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) mutations. We have found for the first time a germ-line mutation in PHD1 in one patient and a novel germ-line PHD2 mutation in a second patient. Both mutants exhibited reduced protein stability with substantial quantitative protein loss and thus compromised catalytic activities. Due to the unique association of patients' polycythemia with borderline or mildly elevated erythropoietin (EPO) levels, we also performed an in vitro sensitivity assay of erythroid progenitors to EPO and for EPO receptor (EPOR) expression. The results show inappropriate hypersensitivity of erythroid progenitors to EPO in these patients, indicating increased EPOR expression/activity. In addition, the present study indicates that HIF dysregulation due to PHD mutations plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these tumors and associated polycythemia. The PHD1 mutation appears to be a new member contributing to the genetic landscape of this novel clinical entity. Our results support the existence of a specific PHD1- and PHD2-associated PHEO/PGL-polycythemia disorder. KEY MESSAGE • A novel germ-l i n e PHD1 mutation causing heochromocytoma/paraganglioma and polycythemia. • Increased EPOR activity and inappropriate hypersensitivity of erythroid progenitors to EPO.},

Analysis of these large, diverse data sets holds the promise of a more comprehensive understanding of the genome and its relation to human disease. Experienced and knowledgeable human review is an essential component of this process, complementing computational approaches. This calls for efficient and intuitive visualization tools able to scale to very large data sets and to flexibly integrate multiple data types, including clinical data.

abstract = {Iron is essential for many biological processes, including oxygen delivery, and its supply is tightly regulated. Hepcidin, a small peptide synthesized in the liver, is a key regulator of iron absorption and homeostasis in mammals. Hepcidin production is increased by iron overload and decreased by anemia and hypoxia; but the molecular mechanisms that govern the hepcidin response to these stimuli are not known. Here we establish that the von Hippel-Lindau/hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (VHL/HIF) pathway is an essential link between iron homeostasis and hepcidin regulation in vivo. Through coordinate downregulation of hepcidin and upregulation of erythropoietin and ferroportin, the VHL-HIF pathway mobilizes iron to support erythrocyte production.},

abstract = {Computing has revolutionized the biological sciences over the past several decades, such that virtually all contemporary research in the biosciences utilizes computer programs. The computational advances have come on many fronts, spurred by fundamental developments in hardware, software, and algorithms. These advances have influenced, and even engendered, a phenomenal array of bioscience fields, including molecular evolution and bioinformatics; genome-, proteome-, transcriptome- and metabolome-wide experimental studies; structural genomics; and atomistic simulations of cellular-scale molecular assemblies as large as ribosomes and intact viruses. In short, much of post-genomic biology is increasingly becoming a form of computational biology. The ability to design and write computer programs is among the most indispensable skills that a modern researcher can cultivate. Python has become a popular programming language in the biosciences, largely because (i) its straightforward semantics and clean syntax make it a readily accessible first language; (ii) it is expressive and well-suited to object-oriented programming, as well as other modern paradigms; and (iii) the many available libraries and third-party toolkits extend the functionality of the core language into virtually every biological domain (sequence and structure analyses, phylogenomics, workflow management systems, etc.). This primer offers a basic introduction to coding, via Python, and it includes concrete examples and exercises to illustrate the language's usage and capabilities; the main text culminates with a final project in structural bioinformatics. A suite of Supplemental Chapters is also provided. Starting with basic concepts, such as that of a 'variable', the Chapters methodically advance the reader to the point of writing a graphical user interface to compute the Hamming distance between two DNA sequences.},

abstract = {Low-oxygen tolerance is supported by an adaptive response that includes a coordinate shift in metabolism and the activation of a transcriptional program that is driven by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. The precise contribution of HIF-1a in the adaptive response, however, has not been determined. Here, we investigate how HIF influences hypoxic adaptation throughout Drosophila melanogaster development. We find that hypoxic-induced transcriptional changes are comprised of HIF-dependent and HIF-independent pathways that are distinct and separable. We show that normoxic set-points of carbohydrate metabolites are significantly altered in sima mutants and that these animals are unable to mobilize glycogen in hypoxia. Furthermore, we find that the estrogen-related receptor (dERR), which is a global regulator of aerobic glycolysis in larvae, is required for a competent hypoxic response. dERR binds to dHIFa and participates in the HIF-dependent transcriptional program in hypoxia. In addition, dERR acts in the absence of dHIFa in hypoxia and a significant portion of HIF-independent transcriptional responses can be attributed to dERR actions, including upregulation of glycolytic transcripts. These results indicate that competent hypoxic responses arise from complex interactions between HIF-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and that dERR plays a central role in both of these programs.},

abstract = {Erythrocytosis can arise from deregulation of the erythropoietin (Epo) axis resulting from defects in the oxygen-sensing pathway. Epo synthesis is controlled by the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) complex, composed of an alpha and a beta subunit. There are 2 main alpha subunits, HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha. Recently, a HIF-2 alpha Gly537Trp mutation was identified in a family with erythrocytosis. This raises the possibility of HIF2A mutations being associated with other cases of erythrocytosis. We now report a subsequent analysis of HIF2A in a cohort of 75 erythrocytosis patients and identify 4 additional patients with novel heterozygous Met535Val and Gly537Arg mutations. All patients presented at a young age with elevated serum Epo. Mutations at Gly-537 account for 4 of 5 HIF2A mutations associated with erythrocytosis. These findings support the importance of HIF-2 alpha in human Epo regulation and warrant investigation of HIF2A in patients with unexplained erythrocytosis.},

abstract = {With the advent of high-throughput and relatively inexpensive whole-genome sequencing technology, the focus of cancer research has begun to shift toward analyses of somatic mutations in non-coding cis-regulatory elements of the cancer genome. Cis-regulatory elements play an important role in gene regulation, with mutations in these elements potentially resulting in changes to the expression of linked genes. The recent discoveries of recurrent TERT promoter mutations in melanoma, and recurrent mutations that create a super-enhancer regulating TAL1 expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), have sparked significant interest in the search for other somatic cis-regulatory mutations driving cancer development. In this review, we look more closely at the TERT promoter and TAL1 enhancer alterations and use these examples to ask whether other cis-regulatory mutations may play a role in cancer susceptibility. In doing so, we make observations from the data emerging from recent research in this field, and describe the experimental and analytical approaches which could be adopted in the hope of better uncovering the true functional significance of somatic cis-regulatory mutations in cancer.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activates erythropoietin gene transcription in Hep3B cells subjected to hypoxia. HIF-1 activity is also induced by hypoxia in non-erythropoietin-producing cells, suggesting a more general regulatory role. We now report that RNAs encoding the glycolytic enzymes aldolase A (ALDA), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), and pyruvate kinase M were induced by exposure of Hep3B or HeLa cells to inducers of HIF-1 (1{\%} O2, cobalt chloride, or desferrioxamine), whereas cycloheximide blocked induction of glycolytic RNAs and HIF-1 activity. Oligonucleotides from the ALDA, PGK1, enolase 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, and phosphofructokinase L (PFKL) genes, containing sequences similar to the HIF-1 binding site in the erythropoietin enhancer, specifically bound HIF-1 present in crude nuclear extracts or affinity-purified preparations. Sequences from the ALDA, PFKL, and PGK1 genes containing HIF-1 binding sites mediated hypoxia-inducible transcription in transient expression assays. These results support the role of HIF-1 as a mediator of adaptive responses to hypoxia that underlie cellular and systemic oxygen homeostasis.},

With a nested approach, the variation introduced at each hierarchy layer is assessed relative to the layer below it. We can use the relative noise contribution of each layer to optimally allocate experimental resources using nested analysis of variance (ANOVA), which generally addresses replication and blocking, previously discussed ad hoc1,2. Recall that factors are independent variables whose values we control and wish to study3 and which have systematic effects on the response. Noise limits our ability to detect effects, but known noise sources (e.g., cell culture) can be mitigated if used as blocking factors2. We can model the contribution of each blocking factor to the overall variability, isolate it and increase power2. Statisticians distinguish between fixed factors, typically treatments, and random factors, such as blocks.},

abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq) assays identify where proteins bind throughout a genome. However, DNA contamination and DNA fragmentation heterogeneity produce false positives (erroneous calls) and imprecision in mapping. Consequently, stringent data filtering produces false negatives (missed calls). Here we describe ChIP-exo, where an exonuclease trims ChIP DNA to a precise distance from the crosslinking site. Bound locations are detectable as peak pairs by deep sequencing. Contaminating DNA is degraded or fails to form complementary peak pairs. With the single bp accuracy provided by ChIP-exo, we show an unprecedented view into genome-wide binding of the yeast transcription factors Reb1, Gal4, Phd1, Rap1, and human CTCF. Each of these factors was chosen to address potential limitations of ChIP-exo. We found that binding sites become unambiguous and reveal diverse tendencies governing in vivo DNA-binding specificity that include sequence variants, functionally distinct motifs, motif clustering, secondary interactions, and combinatorial modules within a compound motif. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) mediate the transcriptional adaptation of hypoxic cells. The extensive transcriptional programm regulated by HIFs involves the induction of genes controlling angiogenesis, cellular metabolism, cell growth, metastasis, apoptosis, extracellular matrix remodeling and others. HIF is a heterodimer of HIF- and HIF-$\beta$ subunits. In addition to HIF-1, HIF-2 has evolved as an isoform that contributes differently to the hypoxic adaptation by performing non-redundant functions. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a nuclear protein involved in the control of DNA repair and gene transcription by modulating chromatin structure and acting as part of gene-specific enhancer/promoter-binding complexes. Previous results have shown that PARP-1 regulates HIF-1 activity. In this study, we focused on the cross-talk between HIF-2 and PARP-1. By using different approaches to suppress PARP-1, we show that HIF-2 mRNA expression, protein levels and HIF-2-dependent gene expression, such as ANGPTL4 and erythropoietin (EPO), are regulated by PARP-1. This regulation occurs at both the transcriptional and post-trancriptional level. We also show a complex formation between HIF-2 with PARP-1. This complex is sensitive to PARP inhibition and seems to protect against the von Hippel-Lindau-dependent HIF-2 degradation. Finally, we show that parp-1-/-mice display a significant reduction in the circulating hypoxia-induced EPO levels, number of red cells and hemoglobin concentration. Altogether, these results reveal a complex functional interaction between PARP-1 and the HIF system and suggest that PARP-1 is involved in the fine tuning of the HIF-mediated hypoxic response in vivo. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Here we studied its effect on hypoxia-inducible factor-1$\alpha$ (HIF-1$\alpha$) in human proximal tubular cells HK-2. 15d-PGJ2 induced stabilization of HIF-1$\alpha$ protein, without affecting HIF-1$\alpha$ mRNA levels or proteasome activity, leading to its nuclear accumulation and activation of HIF-induced transcription. Accumulation of HIF-1$\alpha$ was unaffected by selective PPAR$\gamma$ blockade nor mimicked by the PPAR$\gamma$ agonists ciglitazone and 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ2. N-acetylcysteine, reduced glutathione (GSH) or dithiothreitol (i.e. agents that act as thiol reducing agents and/or increase the GSH content), but not reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, prevented 15d-PGJ2-induced HIF-1$\alpha$ accumulation whereas the inhibitor of GSH synthesis buthionine sulfoximine cooperated with 15d-PGJ2 to accumulate HIF-1$\alpha$. Finally, HIF-1$\alpha$ expression was increased by the electrophilic $\alpha$,$\beta$-unsaturated compounds acrolein and PGA2, but not by 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ2, which lacks the electrophilic cyclopentenone moiety. Taken together, these results point out to a new mechanism to increase pharmacologically the cell levels of HIF-1$\alpha$ through the electrophilic reaction of $\alpha$,$\beta$-unsaturated ketones with thiol groups. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This is the most life-threatening event of tumor progression, and so research is intensely focused on elucidating the mechanisms responsible for invasion and metastasis. The Ras superfamily of GTPases comprises several subfamilies of small GTP-binding proteins whose functions include the control of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, as well as cytoskeleton organization. The development of metastasis is a multistep process that requires coordinated activation of proliferation, motility, changes in normal cell-to-cell and cell-to-substrate contacts, degradation of extracellular matrix, inhibition of apoptosis, and adaptation to an inappropriate tissue environment. Several members of the Ras superfamily of proteins have been implicated in these processes. The present review summarizes the current knowledge in this field.},

abstract = {Growth factors activate phospholipases, causing the generation of diverse lipid metabolites with second messenger function. Among them, the phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase D (PLD) has attracted great interest, since in addition to the transient activation by growth factors stimulation, it is constitutively activated in some of the src- and ras- transformed cells investigated. To establish further the functional relationship of ras oncogenes with PLD, we have investigated its mechanism of regulation. Growth factors such as PDGF or FGF activate the PC-PLD enzyme by a common, PKC-dependent mechanism. By contrast, ras oncogenes activate the PC-PLD enzyme by a PKC-independent mechanism. These results suggest the existence of at least two mechanisms for PLD activation, and ras oncogenes contribute to one of them.},

abstract = {Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5), also known as big mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1, is implicated in a wide range of biologic processes, which include proliferation or vascularization. Here, we show that ERK5 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, in a process mediated by the tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, through a prolyl hydroxylation-dependent mechanism. Our conclusions derive from transient transfection assays in Cos7 cells, as well as the study of endogenous ERK5 in different experimental systems such as MCF7, HMEC, or Caki-2 cell lines. In fact, the specific knockdown of ERK5 in pVHL-negative cell lines promotes a decrease in proliferation and migration, supporting the role of this MAPK in cellular transformation. Furthermore, in a short series of fresh samples from human clear cell renal cell carcinoma, high levels of ERK5 correlate with more aggressive and metastatic stages of the disease. Therefore, our results provide new biochemical data suggesting that ERK5 is a novel target of the tumor suppressor VHL, opening a new field of research on the role of ERK5 in renal carcinomas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

@article{Carnero1994,
abstract = {Mitogenic stimulation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts with growth factors or ras oncogenes is associated with an increase in the levels of phosphorylcholine and diacylglycerol. Both metabolites could be generated as a result of direct activation of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) or by a more complex pathway, involving activation of phospholipase D followed by choline kinase and phosphatidic acid-hydrolase. We show evidence indicating that the generation of phosphorylcholine and diacylglycerol follow independent mechanisms in both serum-treated and in ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. No significant activation of a PC-PLC enzyme was observed. Instead, activation of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PC-PLD) was detected. Moreover, while a fivefold constitutive activation of the endogenous PLD activity and a twofold increase on the levels of phosphatidic acid were observed in ras-transformed cells, very small alterations on these parameters were detected at late times after serum stimulation of quiescent cells. Thus, cell proliferation induced by ras oncogenes in fibroblasts cells may be functionally linked to activation of a PC-PLD enzyme. The differences found in the activation of this enzyme between ras-transformed and normal cells may constitute an important difference in mitogenic signalling between normal and transformed cells.},

abstract = {We have previously reported that rho genes, members of the ras superfamily, are tumorigenic when overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells. As other known oncogenes, they also induce apoptosis after serum deprivation but not in the presence of growth factors. In the present study, we provide evidence that overexpression of the Aplysia Rho protein in NIH 3T3 cells induces the generation of phosphatidylcholine (PC)-derived second messengers as a result of activation of a PC-specific phospholipase D (PC-PLD) as previously reported for ras-transformed cells. In contrast, removal of serum in the Rho transfectants, but not in normal NIH 3T3 cells or cells transformed by the ras oncogene, induced the production of ceramides as a result of activation of an sphingomyelinase (SMase). Furthermore, the rho-expressing cells underwent apoptosis in the presence of serum when exogenous ceramides were added, and this process was accelerated if cells were treated with exogenous SMase. Thus, Rho proteins act as an initiation signal that is necessary but not sufficient for the induction of apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells. We propose here that induction of apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells requires two complementary signals: an initiation signal generated even in the presence of serum which 'primes' the cells, making them sensitive to a progression signal, triggered by serum removal, which we have identified as generation of ceramides.},

abstract = {Demand for new technologies that deliver fast, inexpensive and accurate genome information has never been greater. This challenge has catalysed the rapid development of advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS). The generation of large volumes of sequence data and the speed of data acquisition are the primary advantages over previous, more standard methods. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration granted marketing authorisation for the first high-throughput NG sequencer, Illumina's MiSeqDx, which allowed the development and use of a large number of new genome-based tests. Here, we present a review of template preparation, nucleic acid sequencing and imaging, genome assembly and alignment approaches as well as recent advances in current and near-term commercially available NGS instruments. We also outline the broad range of applications for NGS technologies and provide guidelines for platform selection to best address biological questions of interest. DNA sequencing has revolutionised biological and medical research, and is poised to have a similar impact on the practice of medicine. This tool is but one of an increasing arsenal of developing tools that enhance our capabilities to identify, quantify and functionally characterise the components of biological networks that keep us healthy or make us sick. Despite advances in other omic' technologies, DNA sequencing and analysis, in many respects, have played the leading role to date. The new technologies provide a bridge between genotype and phenotype, both in man and model organisms, and have revolutionised how risk of developing a complex human disease may be assessed. The generation of large DNA sequence data sets is producing a wealth of medically relevant information on a large number of individuals and populations that will potentially form the basis of truly individualised medical care in the future.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) mediate the cellular response to hypoxia. HIF-DNA binding triggers a transcriptional program that acts to both restore oxygen homeostasis and adapt cells to low oxygen availability. In this context, HIF is centrally involved in many physiologic and pathophysiological processes such as development, high altitude adaptation, ischemic disease, inflammation, and cancer. The recent development of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to genome-wide DNA sequence analysis allows the position and extent of HIF binding to DNA to be characterized across the entire genome and correlated with genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional analyses. This review summarizes recent pan-genomic analyses of HIF binding and HIF-dependent transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {Cigarette smoking is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mucus hypersecretion is the key manifestation in patients with COPD and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is a major component of airway mucus. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcriptional factor which can be stimulated to bind to the MUC5AC promoter and induce MUC5AC promoter activation. Previous studies have reported that activation of HIF-1$\alpha$ pathways by cigarette smoke contributes to the development of COPD. We hypothesize that cigarette smoke up-regulates HIF-1$\alpha$ production and HIF-1 activity through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activated signal cascades pathways, leading to mucin production in human airway epithelial cells (16HBE). We show that cigarette smoke increases HIF-1$\alpha$ production, HIF-1 activity and MUC5AC expression. These effects are prevented by small interfering RNA (siRNA) for HIF-1$\alpha$, indicating that cigarette smoke-induced mucin production is HIF-1$\alpha$-dependent. Cigarette smoke activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signal pathways, both of which are inhibited by gefitinib (an inhibitor of EGFR), suggesting that cigarette smoke-activated signal pathways are mediated by EGFR in 16HBE cells. Furthermore, pretreatment with gefitinib and the pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002) and ERK1/2 (PD98059) prevented cigarette smoke-mediated Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation responses, HIF-1$\alpha$ production, HIF-1 activity and MUC5AC expression. These observations demonstrate an important role for EGFR-mediated signaling pathways in regulating cigarette smoke-induced HIF-1 activation and MUC5AC expression. Our results suggest that cigarette smoke activates EGFR-mediated signaling pathways, leading to HIF-1$\alpha$ production and HIF-1 activation, resulting in mucin expression in human airway epithelial cells.},

abstract = {Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a multifunctional secreted glycoprotein that displays broad anti-tumor activity based on dual targeting of the tumor microenvironment (anti-angiogenic action) and the tumor cells (direct anti-tumor action). Here, we show that PEDF expression is high in melanocytes, but it is lost during malignant progression of human melanoma. Using a high-throughput analysis of the data from microarray studies of molecular profiling of human melanoma, we found that PEDF expression is lost in highly invasive melanomas. In paired cell lines established from the same lesion but representing the high and low extremes of malignant potential, abundant PEDF expression was restricted to the poorly aggressive counterparts. We used RNA interference to directly address the functional consequences of PEDF silencing. PEDF knockdown in poorly aggressive melanoma cell lines augmented migration, invasion and vasculogenic mimicry, which translated into an increased in vivo metastatic potential. PEDF interference also significantly enhanced the migratory and invasive capability of normal melanocytes and moderately increased their proliferative potential. Our results show that loss of PEDF enables melanoma cells to acquire an invasive phenotype and, therefore, modulation of this multifunctional factor could be critical for the malignant progression of human melanoma.},

abstract = {Early adaptive responses to hypoxia are essential for cell survival, but their nature and underlying mechanisms are poorly known. We have studied the post-transcriptional changes in mammalian cells' proteome elicited by acute hypoxia and found that phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), a ribosomal translocase whose phosphorylation inhibits protein synthesis, is under precise and reversible control of O2 tension. Upon exposure to hypoxia, phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr56 occurs rapidly ({\textless} 15 min) and results in modest translational arrest, a fundamental homeostatic response to hypoxia that spares ATP and thus facilitates cell survival. Acute inhibitory eEF2 phosphorylation occurs without ATP depletion or AMP kinase activation. Furthermore, eEF2 phosphorylation is mimicked by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) inhibition with dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) or by selective PHD2 siRNA-silencing, but is independent of hypoxia inducible factor $\alpha$ stabilization. Moreover, over-expression of PHD2 blocks hypoxic accumulation of phosphorylated eEF2. Therefore, our findings suggest that eEF2 phosphorylation status, and as a consequence translational rate, is controlled by PHD2 activity. They unravel a novel pathway for cell adaptation to hypoxia that could have pathophysiologic relevance in tissue ischemia and cancer.},

abstract = {Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a peptide hormone with potent vasoconstrictor properties which is synthesized and secreted predominantly by vascular endothelial cells. Its production is regulated by numerous stimuli including ischemia and hypoxia, and the enhanced levels that occur during myocardial ischemia may contribute to the progression of heart failure. We reported previously a preliminary characterization of a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) binding site in the human ET-1 promoter which contributed to the activation of ET-1 expression in endothelial cells. We report here that the HIF-1 binding site alone is not sufficient for the response to hypoxia but requires an additional 50 base pairs of flanking sequence that includes binding sites for the factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), GATA-2, and CAAT-binding factor (NF-1). Mutation of any one of these sites or the HIF-1 site eliminated induction by hypoxia. Mutations of the AP-1 and GATA-2 sites, but not the HIF-1 site, were complemented by overexpressing AP-1, GATA-2, HIF-1alpha, or the activator protein p300/CBP, restoring the response to hypoxia. Binding studies in vitro confirmed physical associations among GATA-2, AP-1, and HIF-1 factors. Overexpression or depletion of p300/CBP modulated the level of ET-1 promoter expression as well as the endogenous ET-1 transcript but did not change the fold induction by hypoxia in either case. Regulation of the ET-1 promoter by hypoxia in non-endothelial cells required overexpression of GATA-2 and HIF-1alpha. The results support essential roles for AP-1, GATA-2, and NF-1 in stabilizing the binding of HIF-1 and promoting recruitment of p300/CBP to the ET-1 hypoxia response complex.},

abstract = {15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin-J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) is a peroxisome-activated proliferator receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonist which contains an alpha,beta-unsaturated electrophilic ketone involved in nucleophilic addition reactions to thiols. Here we studied its effect on hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) in human proximal tubular cells HK-2. 15d-PGJ(2) induced stabilization of HIF-1alpha protein, without affecting HIF-1alpha mRNA levels or proteasome activity, leading to its nuclear accumulation and activation of HIF-induced transcription. Accumulation of HIF-1alpha was unaffected by selective PPARgamma blockade nor mimicked by the PPARgamma agonists ciglitazone and 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ(2). N-acetylcysteine, reduced glutathione (GSH) or dithiothreitol (i.e. agents that act as thiol reducing agents and/or increase the GSH content), but not reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, prevented 15d-PGJ(2)-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation whereas the inhibitor of GSH synthesis buthionine sulfoximine cooperated with 15d-PGJ(2) to accumulate HIF-1alpha. Finally, HIF-1alpha expression was increased by the electrophilic alpha,beta-unsaturated compounds acrolein and PGA(2), but not by 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ(2), which lacks the electrophilic cyclopentenone moiety. Taken together, these results point out to a new mechanism to increase pharmacologically the cell levels of HIF-1alpha through the electrophilic reaction of alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones with thiol groups.},

HIF transcriptional activity is suppressed under normoxic conditions by hydroxylation of an asparagine residue within its C-terminal transactivation domain, blocking association with coactivators.

Like known hydroxylase enzymes, FIH-1 is an Fe(II)-dependent enzyme that uses molecular O(2) to modify its substrate. Together with the recently discovered prolyl hydroxylases that regulate HIF stability, this class of oxygen-dependent enzymes comprises critical regulatory components of the hypoxic response pathway.},

Although studies of VHL-defective renal carcinoma cells suggest the existence of other VHL tumor suppressor pathways, dysregulation of the HIF transcriptional cascade has extensive effects that make it difficult to distinguish whether, and to what extent, observed abnormalities in these cells represent effects on pathways that are distinct from HIF. Here, we report on a genetic analysis of HIF-dependent and -independent effects of VHL inactivation by studying gene expression patterns in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show tight conservation of the HIF-1/VHL-1/EGL-9 hydroxylase pathway. However, persisting differential gene expression in hif-1 versus hif-1; vhl-1 double mutant worms clearly distinguished HIF-1-independent effects of VHL-1 inactivation. Genomic clustering, predicted functional similarities, and a common pattern of dysregulation in both vhl-1 worms and a set of mutants (dpy-18, let-268, gon-1, mig-17, and unc-6), with different defects in extracellular matrix formation, suggest that dysregulation of these genes reflects a discrete HIF-1-independent function of VHL-1 that is connected with extracellular matrix function.},

We assessed the difference in transcription activity of two HIF-1alpha polymorphic variants (P582S and A588T), along with molecular epidemiological study among head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Both HIF-1alpha variants revealed significantly higher transcription activity than wild-type (WT) did, under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (P {\textless} 0.02). Furthermore, tumors from HNSCC patients with heterozygous alleles having P582S or A588T had significantly increased numbers of microvessels compared with those with homozygous WT (P = 0.02). In addition, all patients with tumors of T1 (below 2 cm diameter) were WT, while 14 of 47 patients with tumors of {\textgreater} or =T2 were heterozygous. The elevated transactivation capacity of variant forms of HIF-1alpha implies a role of HIF-1alpha polymorphisms in generating individually different tumor progression.},

abstract = {p300 and CBP are homologous transcription adapters targeted by the E1A oncoprotein. They participate in numerous biological processes, including cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and transcription activation. p300 and/or CBP (p300/CBP) also coactivate CREB. How they participate in these processes is not yet known. In a search for specific p300 binding proteins, we have cloned the intact cDNA for HIF-1 alpha. This transcription factor mediates hypoxic induction of genes encoding certain glycolytic enzymes, erythropoietin (Epo), and vascular endothelial growth factor. Hypoxic conditions lead to the formation of a DNA binding complex containing both HIF-1 alpha and p300/CBP. Hypoxia-induced transcription from the Epo promoter was specifically enhanced by ectopic p300 and inhibited by E1A binding to p300/CBP. Hypoxia-induced VEGF and Epo mRNA synthesis were similarly inhibited by E1A. Hence, p300/CBP-HIF complexes participate in the induction of hypoxia-responsive genes, including one (vascular endothelial growth factor) that plays a major role in tumor angiogenesis. Paradoxically, these data, to our knowledge for the first time, suggest that p300/ CBP are active in both transformation suppression and tumor development.},

abstract = {Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) occurs in patients with sleep apnoea and has adverse effects on multiple physiological functions. Previous studies have shown that reflexes arising from carotid bodies mediate CIH-evoked cardio-respiratory responses, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in eliciting systemic responses to CIH. Very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying CIH. The transcriptional activator hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) mediates a broad range of cellular and systemic responses to hypoxia, and HIF-1 is activated in cell cultures exposed to IH. In the present study we examined whether CIH activates HIF-1 and if so whether it contributes to cardio-respiratory responses and ROS generation in mice. Experiments were performed on male littermate wild-type (WT) and heterozygous (HET) mice partially deficient in HIF-1alpha, the O2 regulated subunit of the HIF-1 complex. Both groups of mice were exposed to either 10 days of CIH (15 s of hypoxia followed by 5 min of normoxia, 9 episodes h-1, 8 h day-1) or to 10 days of 21{\%} O2 (controls). Carotid body response to hypoxia was augmented, and acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) induced sensory long-term facilitation (sLTF) of the chemoreceptor activity in CIH-exposed WT mice. In striking contrast, hypoxic sensory response was unaffected and AIH was ineffective in eliciting sLTF in CIH-exposed HET mice. Analysis of cardio-respiratory responses in CIH-exposed WT mice revealed augmented hypoxic ventilatory response, LTF of breathing, elevated blood pressures and increased plasma noradrenaline. In striking contrast these responses were either absent or attenuated in HET mice exposed to CIH. In CIH-exposed WT mice, ROS were elevated and this response was absent in HET mice. Manganese (III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin pentachloride, a potent scavenger of superoxide, not only prevented CIH-induced increases in ROS but also CIH-evoked HIF-1alpha up-regulation in WT mice. These results indicate that: (a) HIF-1 activation is critical for eliciting CIH-induced carotid body-mediated cardio-respiratory responses; (b) CIH increases ROS; and (c) the effects of CIH involve complex positive interactions between HIF-1 and ROS.},

O(2)-dependent binding of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein targets the HIF-1alpha subunit for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The activity of the HIF-1alpha transactivation domains is also O(2) regulated by a previously undefined mechanism. Here, we report the identification of factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1), a protein that binds to HIF-1alpha and inhibits its transactivation function. In addition, we demonstrate that FIH-1 binds to VHL and that VHL also functions as a transcriptional corepressor that inhibits HIF-1alpha transactivation function by recruiting histone deacetylases. Involvement of VHL in association with FIH-1 provides a unifying mechanism for the modulation of HIF-1alpha protein stabilization and transcriptional activation in response to changes in cellular O(2) concentration.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are broadly expressed in human cancers, and HIF1$\alpha$ and HIF2$\alpha$ were previously suspected to promote tumour progression through largely overlapping functions. However, this relatively simple model has now been challenged in light of recent data from various approaches that reveal unique and sometimes opposing activities of these HIF$\alpha$ isoforms in both normal physiology and disease. These effects are mediated in part through the regulation of unique target genes, as well as through direct and indirect interactions with important oncoproteins and tumour suppressors, including MYC and p53. As HIF inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical evaluation as cancer therapeutics, a more thorough understanding of the unique roles performed by HIF1$\alpha$ and HIF2$\alpha$ in human neoplasia is warranted.},

abstract = {Recent research has identified critical roles for microRNAs in a large number of cellular processes, including tumorigenic transformation. While significant progress has been made towards understanding the mechanisms of gene regulation by microRNAs, much less is known about factors affecting the expression of these noncoding transcripts. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between hypoxia, a well-documented tumor microenvironment factor, and microRNA expression. Microarray-based expression profiles revealed that a specific spectrum of microRNAs (including miR-23, -24, -26, -27, -103, -107, -181, -210, and -213) is induced in response to low oxygen, at least some via a hypoxia-inducible-factor-dependent mechanism. Select members of this group (miR-26, -107, and -210) decrease proapoptotic signaling in a hypoxic environment, suggesting an impact of these transcripts on tumor formation. Interestingly, the vast majority of hypoxia-induced microRNAs are also overexpressed in a variety of human tumors.},

Although recent studies have extended lysine methylation to nonhistone proteins, underlying molecular mechanisms such as the upstream signaling cascade that induces lysine methylation and downstream target genes modulated by this modification have not been elucidated. Here, we show that Reptin, a chromatin-remodeling factor, is methylated at lysine 67 in hypoxic conditions by the methyltransferase G9a. Methylated Reptin binds to the promoters of a subset of hypoxia-responsive genes and negatively regulates transcription of these genes to modulate cellular responses to hypoxia.},

abstract = {Biochemical systems biology augments more traditional disciplines, such as genomics, biochemistry and molecular biology, by championing (i) mathematical and computational modeling; (ii) the application of traditional engineering practices in the analysis of biochemical systems; and in the past decade increasingly (iii) the use of near-comprehensive data sets derived from 'omics platform technologies, in particular "downstream" technologies relative to genome sequencing, including transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. The future progress in understanding biological principles will increasingly depend on the development of temporal and spatial analytical techniques that will provide high-resolution data for systems analyses. To date, particularly successful were strategies involving (a) quantitative measurements of cellular components at the mRNA, protein and metabolite levels, as well as in vivo metabolic reaction rates, (b) development of mathematical models that integrate biochemical knowledge with the information generated by high-throughput experiments, and (c) applications to microbial organisms. The inevitable role bioinformatics plays in modern systems biology puts mathematical and computational sciences as an equal partner to analytical and experimental biology. Furthermore, mathematical and computational models are expected to become increasingly prevalent representations of our knowledge about specific biochemical systems.},

@article{Hu2003,
abstract = {Transcriptional responses to hypoxia are primarily mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a heterodimer of HIF-alpha and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator subunits. The HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha subunits are structurally similar in their DNA binding and dimerization domains but differ in their transactivation domains, implying they may have unique target genes. Previous studies using Hif-1alpha(-/-) embryonic stem and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells show that loss of HIF-1alpha eliminates all oxygen-regulated transcriptional responses analyzed, suggesting that HIF-2alpha is dispensable for hypoxic gene regulation. In contrast, HIF-2alpha has been shown to regulate some hypoxia-inducible genes in transient transfection assays and during embryonic development in the lung and other tissues. To address this discrepancy, and to identify specific HIF-2alpha target genes, we used DNA microarray analysis to evaluate hypoxic gene induction in cells expressing HIF-2alpha but not HIF-1alpha. In addition, we engineered HEK293 cells to express stabilized forms of HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha via a tetracycline-regulated promoter. In this first comparative study of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha target genes, we demonstrate that HIF-2alpha does regulate a variety of broadly expressed hypoxia-inducible genes, suggesting that its function is not restricted, as initially thought, to endothelial cell-specific gene expression. Importantly, HIF-1alpha (and not HIF-2alpha) stimulates glycolytic gene expression in both types of cells, clearly showing for the first time that HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha have unique targets.},

abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been rapidly adopted for the profiling of transcriptomes in many areas of biology, including studies into gene regulation, development and disease. Of particular interest is the discovery of differentially expressed genes across different conditions (e.g., tissues, perturbations) while optionally adjusting for other systematic factors that affect the data-collection process. There are a number of subtle yet crucial aspects of these analyses, such as read counting, appropriate treatment of biological variability, quality control checks and appropriate setup of statistical modeling. Several variations have been presented in the literature, and there is a need for guidance on current best practices. This protocol presents a state-of-the-art computational and statistical RNA-seq differential expression analysis workflow largely based on the free open-source R language and Bioconductor software and, in particular, on two widely used tools, DESeq and edgeR. Hands-on time for typical small experiments (e.g., 4-10 samples) can be {\textless}1 h, with computation time {\textless}1 d using a standard desktop PC.},

abstract = {We report the generation and analysis of functional data from multiple, diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1{\%} of the human genome as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome function.},

abstract = {Adaptation to hypoxia is mediated through a coordinated transcriptional response driven largely by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). We used ChIP-chip and gene expression profiling to identify direct targets of HIF-1 transactivation on a genome-wide scale. Several hundred direct HIF-1 targets were identified and, as expected, were highly enriched for proteins that facilitate metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. Surprisingly, there was also striking enrichment for the family of 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenases, including the jumonji-domain histone demethylases. We demonstrate that these histone demethylases are direct HIF targets, and their up-regulation helps maintain epigenetic homeostasis under hypoxic conditions. These results suggest that the coordinated increase in expression of several oxygen-dependent enzymes by HIF may help compensate for decreased levels of oxygen under conditions of cellular hypoxia.},
